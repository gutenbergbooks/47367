<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>It is much to be regretted, that of late years, so little attention
has been given in this country, to the study of pomology, and that
so few efforts have been made to encourge a taste for this most
important, most instructive, and intellectual branch of horticultural
science.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last, and beginning of the present century,
when the late Mr. Knight was in the full vigor of his scientific
pursuits, this was the subject which engaged so much of his powerful
intellect, and from which he succeeded in producing such great
and beneficial results. With Mr. Knight as president, and Mr.
Sabine as secretary, the Horticultural Society of London did much
for the advancement of this subject, and in extending a knowledge
not only of the fruits of this country, but of the most valuable varieties
of the continent of Europe, and America. Through the exertions
of these gentlemen, and in conjunction with the illustrious pomologists,
Dr. Diel and Professor Van Mons, and other eminent continental
correspondents, was obtained that vast collection of fruits
which once existed in the Society’s garden; and by means of which
that great undertaking of determining and arranging the nomenclature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
was accomplished. During this period the Society’s <cite>Transactions</cite>
teemed with rich, and interesting pomological papers, and
several works of a high character were ushered into existence. Of
these the most important were the <cite>Pomonas</cite> of Brookshaw and
Hooker, the <cite>Pomological Magazine</cite>, and Ronalds’s <cite>Pyrus Malus
Brentfordiensis</cite>; but these are all of such a class, as from their
great cost to be regarded more as works of art, than of general
utility. The only one which was at all calculated to be of general
benefit was, Lindley’s “<cite>Guide to the Orchard</cite>;” a work which
furnished descriptions of, and embraced a greater number of
varieties than had hitherto been attempted. This then may be
regarded as the most complete work for general reference, with
which pomologists in this country had ever been furnished.</p>

<p>Upwards of twenty years have now elapsed since the “<cite>Guide to
the Orchard</cite>” issued from the press, and during that period, Knight,
Sabine, and many great patrons of pomology have entered into
their rest, leaving none behind them to prosecute, with the same
vigour, that study which they so much loved and adorned. But
although there has been no corporate effort to promote and stimulate
this study, private enterprize has not altogether been awanting to
keep pace with the rapid progression of the Continent and America;
but for this, we might yet have been in total ignorance of many of
the most desirable fruits of modern times, and particularly of those
valuable varieties, the result of the later labors of Van Mons,
Esperen, and others; together with several of considerable merit,
furnished by the fertile pomology of the New World.</p>

<p>Since the publication of Lindley’s “<cite>Guide</cite>,” therefore, there has
not only been such additions to our varieties of fruits, but such a
complete reformation and arrangement of pomological nomenclature
as to have rendered that book, as a work of reference of considerably
less value; and it was on account of the necessity for a new work,
adapted to the wants of the present day, and embracing the most
recent information on the subject, that I entered upon the present
undertaking. The facilities I have possessed for carrying it out,
are perhaps greater than fall to the lot of most men. My earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
associations were with fruits and fruit trees; the greater part of my
active life has been engaged in their cultivation and devoted to their
study; and for nearly ten years, I had the advantage of making an
annual tour throughout the length and breadth of England and
Scotland, during which, I allowed no opportunity to escape of
making myself acquainted with the fruits of the various districts, and
securing correspondents to whom I could apply, in cases of necessity.
With these advantages, I some years ago established an orchard,
for the purpose of examining the distinctive characters and determining
the nomenclature of fruits; and there I have succeeded, in
securing all the varieties it is possible to procure, either in this
country or abroad, and thereby to obtain from personal observation
all the information attainable on the subject.</p>

<p>In the execution of this work, my object has been, not to give a
mere selection of the best varieties of fruits cultivated in this
country, but to describe minutely, and at length, all the varieties
with their essential characters, distinguishing those which are, and
those which are not worthy of cultivation. I have endeavoured
to embrace all the fruits which are recorded as existing in Great
Britain, and although it cannot be supposed I have been able to obtain
the whole of them, still, I have secured such a number as will
leave but a very small portion un-noticed. The plan which I
have adopted in the general arrangement will be found to embrace
all matters both descriptive, historical, and critical, touching
the several varieties. The nomenclature I have followed is, except in
some instances for reasons given, that of the London Horticultural
Society’s Catalogue, a valuable work prepared by that patient and
indefatigable pomologist, Mr. Robert Thompson. The advantage
of this identity of nomenclature is evident, as it sets at rest that
mass of confusion, which so long existed as to the correct names of
fruits. In describing each variety, the approved name, that is the
name which shall serve as a standard by which that variety shall in
future be distinguished, is printed in Roman Capitals; and either
abbreviated, or in full length, is annexed the name of the author
who first records or describes it. When the variety is of such
antiquity as not to be identified with any particular author, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
name of the one who first distinctly describes it is given. Following
the standard name, is the identification or list of works in which
the variety is identified as being described; the synonymes or
names by which it is mentioned in all works on pomology, or known
in various districts; and then a list of works in which it is most
correctly and faithfully figured. Then follow the description,
history, and critical observations, when such are necessary. I have
furnished diagrams, of the newest, rarest, and most esteemed
varieties; and this mode of illustration conveys a better idea of the
general character of the fruit, than a fore-shortened drawing, and
answers the same purpose as a highly finished engraving, without
swelling the price of the work to such an extent, as to render it unavailable
for ordinary use. At the end, I have given lists of the
most excellent varieties adapted for various districts of the country,
as also such as are suited for being grown as Standards, Dwarfs,
and for Cyder. The whole work is terminated by a copious index,
which includes all the synonymes, and which of itself, will afford
much valuable assistance, in all matters relating to pomological
nomenclature.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to acknowledge the favors I have received
from many kind friends, who have, by furnishing materials and information,
rendered me much valuable assistance. To Mr. Robert
Thompson, already mentioned, I am particularly indebted for the
liberal way in which he has always supplied me with any information
I required. To the late Mr. John Ronalds, of Brentford, for
the free use of his valuable collection; as also to his excellent and
much respected foreman, Mr. William Waring. To Mr. James Lake,
nurseryman, of Bridgewater, for specimens of, and communications
respecting the fruits of the Somerset, Devon, and West of England
orchards. To Mr. William Fairbread, of Green-street, near Sittingbourne,
for those of the great orchard districts of Kent. To
Mr. Mannington, of Uckfield, and Mr. Henry Barton, of Heathfield,
Sussex, for the fruits of these neighbourhoods. To Mr. J. C.
Wheeler, of Gloucester, and the late Mr. Hignell, orchardist, of
Tewkesbury. To George Jefferies, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Marlborough Terrace,
Kensington, for some of the valuable fruits of Norfolk; and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Rev. Henry Manton, of Sleaford. To Mr. Roger Hargreave, of
Lancaster, for a complete collection from the Lancashire <span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘orchards,’ at end of line.">orchards.</span>
To Archibald Turnbull, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Belwood, near Perth, whose choice
and extensive collection, was freely placed at my disposal. To
Mr. A. Gorrie, of Annat, and Robert Mathew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Gourdiehill,
in the Carse of Gowrie, for much valuable information, and
specimens of the fruits of that great orchard district of the North.
To Mr. Evans, superintendent of the Caledonian Horticultural
Society’s Garden, Edinburgh, for much valuable assistance derived
from a free inspection of the collection of the Society. To my
brother, Mr. Thomas Hogg, of Coldstream, for the fruits of the
Tweedside orchards, and to numerous nurserymen and private
individuals, who have aided me in the prosecution of this work,
I now tender my warmest and heartfelt thanks.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_APPLE" id="THE_APPLE">THE APPLE.</a></h2>

<p>There is no fruit, in temperate climates, so universally
esteemed, and so extensively cultivated, nor is there any
which is so closely identified with the social habits of
the human species as the apple. Apart from the many
domestic purposes to which it is applicable, the facility
of its cultivation, and its adaptation to almost every latitude,
have rendered it, in all ages, an object of special
attention and regard. There is no part of our island
where one or other of its numerous varieties is not cultivated,
and few localities where the finest cannot be
brought to perfection.</p>

<p>The apple is a native of this, as well as almost every
other country in Europe. Its normal form is the Common
Wild Crab, the <i>Pyrus Malus</i> of Linnæus, and the
numerous varieties with which our gardens and orchards
abound, are the result either of the natural tendency of
that tree to variation, or by its varieties being hybridized
with the original species, or with each other. It belongs
to the natural order <i>Rosaceæ</i>, section <i>Pomeæ</i>, and is, by
botanists, included in the same genus as the pear. The
principal difference between apples and pears, when considered
botanically, consists in their stamens and styles;
the stamens of the apple have their filaments straight, united
together at the base, and forming a bundle round the
styles, of which they conceal the inferior part. All the
filaments of the pear on the contrary are divergent, disposed
almost like the radii of a wheel, and leave the bases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of the styles entirely naked and exposed. The styles in
the apple are united at their base into one body, and are
generally villous in that part where they adhere to each
other: in the pear, however, they are separate at their
base. But although the apple and pear very much resemble
each other in their botanical characters, they differ very
materially in their form, cellular tissue, and specific gravity.
Apples have always the base umbellicate, or hollowed with
a deep cavity, in which the stalk is inserted, and are
generally spherical. The pear, on the other hand, is
elongated towards the stalk, and is generally of a pyramidal
shape, or nearly so. The cellular tissue of the apple,
according to the microscopical observations of Turpin, is
composed of a great number of agglomerated, distinct
vesicles, each existing independent of the other, varying
in size in the same fruit, and, in general, larger, as the
apple is large and light. These vesicles are colorless and
transparent, and vary in their form according to the want
of space requisite for their individual development. They
contain in greater or less abundance, a sugary, acid, or
bitter juice, which is perceivable in the different varieties.
The cellular tissue of the apple possesses no stony concretions,
and its specific gravity is greater than that of the
pear; so much so, that by taking a cube of each, of equal
size, and throwing them into a vessel of water, that of the
apple will float, while that of the pear will sink. In its
natural or wild state the apple tree is of a small size, attaining
generally about twenty feet in height, of a crooked habit
of growth, with small, harsh, and austere fruit, and small
thin leaves. But when improved by cultivation, it loses
much of its original form, assumes a more free and luxuriant
growth, with larger, thicker, and more downy leaves,
and produces fruit distinguished for its size, color, and
richness of flavor.</p>

<p>Some authors have ascribed the introduction of the apple
into this country to the Romans, and others to the Normans;
in both cases, however, without any evidence or
well grounded authority. Mr. Loudon says, “The apple
was, in all probability, introduced into Britain by the
Romans, as well as the pear; and like that fruit, perhaps,
re-introduced by the heads of religious houses on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
establishment, after the introduction of christianity.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> It
is more probable <span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note: Originally ‘That is has existed’">that it has existed</span> as an indigenous tree
throughout all ages, and that the most ancient varieties
were accidental variations of the original species, with
which the forests abounded. These being cultivated, and
subjected to the art and industry of man, would give rise
to other varieties, and thus a gradual amelioration of the
fruit would be obtained. The earliest records make
mention of the apple in the most familiar terms. That it was
known to the ancient Britons, before the arrival of the
Romans is evident from their language. In Celtic, it is
called <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Abhall</span></i>, or <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Abhal</span></i>; in Welch, <i><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Avall</span></i>; in Armoric,
<i><span lang="br" xml:lang="br">Afall</span></i> and <i><span lang="br" xml:lang="br">Avall</span></i>; in Cornish, <i><span lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Aval</span></i> and <i><span lang="kw" xml:lang="kw">Avel</span></i>. The word is
derived from the pure Celtic, <i><span lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">ball</span></i>, signifying any round
body.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The ancient Glastonbury was called by the Britons
Ynys Avallaç, and Ynys Avallon, which signify an apple
orchard,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and from this its Roman name <i>Avallonia</i> was
derived. The apple must therefore have been known
in Britain before the arrival of the Romans; and that it
continued to exist after they left the island, and before the
Norman conquest, is certified by William of Malmesbury,
who says, that King Edgar in 973, while hunting in a wood
was left alone by his associates; in this situation he was
overcome by an irresistable desire to sleep, and alighting
from his horse he lay down under the shade of a <i>wild
apple tree</i>.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Shortly after the Norman conquest, the same
author writes with reference to Gloucestershire. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cernas
tramites publicos vestitos pomiferis arboribus, non insitiva
manus industria, sed ipsius solius humi natura.</span>” Some
writers<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> entertain the popular error that the cultivation of
apples was not a branch of rural economy in England before
Richard Harris planted orchards in several parts of Kent,
in the reign of Henry the Eighth; but there is evidence
to the contrary. In a bull of Pope Alexander the Third,
in the year 1175, confirming the property belonging to the
monastery of Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire, is mentioned,
“The town of Twining with all the lands, <i>orchards</i>,
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Closing end quotation mark added’.">meadows, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>;”</span><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> and in a charter of King John, granting
property to the priory of Lanthony, near Gloucester, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
mentioned “the church of Herdesley, with twelve acres of
land, <i>and an orchard</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> But its cultivation was not confined
to the southern counties, for we find there was an extensive
manufacture of cider as far north as Richmond, in Yorkshire,
in the early part of the thirteenth century. It would
be too much to say that all the varieties cultivated at an
early period, were indigenous to this country; many no
doubt, were introduced at the Norman conquest, and it is
probable that in the middle ages some varieties were introduced
from the continent, by members of the different
religious houses which then existed, who not unfrequently
had personal intercourse with France, and who devoted
considerable attention to horticulture; but there is every
reason to believe that the earliest varieties were native
productions. The oldest works which treat on the cultivation
of fruits, afford little or no information as to
these early varieties. In some ancient documents of the
twelfth century, we find the Pearmain<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> and Costard mentioned,
but the horticultural works of the period are too
much occupied with the fallacies and nonsense which
distinguish those of the Roman agricultural writers, to
convey to us any knowledge of the early pomology of this
country. Turner in his Herbal, has no record of any of the
varieties, and simply states, in reference to the apple, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I
nede not to descrybe thys tre, because it is knowen well
inoughe in all countres.</span>” Barnaby Googe mentions as,
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Chiefe in price, the Pippin, the Romet, the Pomeroyall,
the Marigold, with a great number of others that were too
long to speake of.</span>” Leonarde Mascal gives instruction how
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">to graffe the Quyne Apple;</span>” but that is the only variety
he mentions. In a note book in the possession of Sir John
Trevelyan, of Nettlecombe, near Taunton, which was kept
by one of his ancestors, from the year 1580 to 1584, is an
entry of “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The names of Apelles, which I had their graffes
from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace&mdash;<i>Item</i>, the Appell out
of Essex; Lethercott, or Russet Apell; Lounden Peppen;
Kew Goneling, or the Croke; Glass Appell or Pearmeane;
Red Stear; Nemes Appell, or Grenlinge; Bellabone; Appell
out of Dorsettsher; Domine quo Vadis.</span>” In “The
Husbandman’s Fruitfull Orchard,” we have Pippins, Pearemains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
John Apples, Winter Russetings, and Leather Coats.
Gerard enumerates and figures “The Pome Water, the
Baker’s Ditch, the King of Apples, the Quining or Queene
of Apples, the Sommer Pearemaine,” and “the Winter
Pearemaine;” and he says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I have seene in the pastures
and hedgerowes about the grounds of a worshippfull gentleman,
dwelling two miles from Hereford, called <i>M. Roger
Bednome</i>, so many trees of all sortes, that the seruants drinke
for the most part no other drinke, but that which is made
of Apples. The quantitie is such, that by the report of the
gentleman himselfe, the parson hath for tithe many hogsheads
of Syder.</span>”</p>

<p>But it is to Parkinson we are indebted for the best
account of the early English varieties, of which he enumerates
no less than fifty-nine, with “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">tweenty sorts of sweetings
and none good</span>;” and from him may be dated the dawn
of British Pomology. Hartlib mentions one who had 200
sorts of apples, and was of opinion that 500 sorts existed.
Rea, in his Pomona, enumerates twenty varieties, sixteen of
which are not mentioned by Parkinson; and Meager gives
a list of eighty-three, which were cultivated in the Brompton
Park, and some other nurseries round London, of which
fifty-one are not found in the lists of either Parkinson or
Rea. Worlidge mentions ninety-two, which are chiefly
cider fruits. The seventy-seven varieties of Ray are much
the same as those enumerated by Worlidge. During the
last century, the writings of Switzer, Langley, Hitt, Miller,
and Abercrombie, added little to what have already been
noticed, except that Switzer first mentions the Nonpareil;
and it is to Forsyth that we are indebted for a more extended
knowledge of the different varieties, then known
to exist in this country. With Thomas Andrew Knight,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, the first President of the London Horticultural
Society, a new era in the history of pomology commenced,
and during his lifetime there was more attention devoted
to this study, than had been since the days of Evelyn and
De Quintinye. It was with this zealous horticulturist,
that a practical application of the discovery of the sexes of
plants, was first systematically carried into operation; and
the success which attended his labors in hybridization, is
evinced by the many valuable varieties of fruits which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
was the means of producing. Through the exertions of
this gentleman, and his illustrious cotemporaries, Sabine,
Williams, and Braddick, the gardens of the Horticultural
Society, became a depository for all the varieties which
could be gathered together from all parts of Europe and
America, and the result has been, that in the last edition
of the Society’s Catalogue, Mr. Thompson has enumerated
upwards of 1400 varieties of the apple alone, the
greater portion of which, however, are proved to be unworthy
of cultivation for any purpose whatever.</p>

<p>The apple is a very wholesome fruit. In its raw state
it is highly esteemed in the dessert, and when either
roasted, boiled, or in pies, it forms an excellent and nutritious
food. Dr. Johnson says he knew a clergyman, of
small income, who brought up a family very reputably,
which he chiefly fed on apple dumplings! Administered
to invalids it is cooling, refreshing, and laxative. It is well
known as furnishing an excellent sauce; and apple jelly
forms one of the finest preserves. Norfolk Beefings are that
variety of apple baked in ovens, after the bread is drawn, and
flattened to the form in which they are sold in the shops of
the confectioners and fruiterers. In Normandy and America,
apples are to a considerable extent dried in the sun, in
which state they may be preserved for a long period and used
at pleasure, when they form an excellent dish stewed with
sugar, cloves, and other spices. Those dried in America are
cut into quarters, while those of Normandy are preserved
whole. There is a drink with which our ancestors were wont
to regale themselves called <i>Lambs-wool</i>, or more properly
<i>Lamasool</i>, a word derived from <i>La maes Abhal</i>, which signifies
the day of apple fruit. This drink was composed of ale
and the pulp of roasted apples, with sugar and spice. It is
mentioned by Gerard, and in an old song, called “The
King and the Miller,” we find it referred to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="p_line">“A cup of <i>Lambs-wool</i> they drank to him there.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="no_indent">Besides these, and many other uses to which the apple is
applied, its juice produces cider, which forms, in many parts
of this country, in Normandy, and the United States, an indispensable
beverage. The juice of the wild species, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
crab vinegar, or verjuice, when applied externally is good
for strains, spasms, and cramps.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of the apple is, chlorophylle,
sugar, gum, vegetable fibre, albumen, malic acid, tannin
and gallic acid, lime, and a great quantity of water.</p>

<p>The apple may be grown on almost any description of
soil, provided it is not absolutely wet. That on which it
succeeds best is a humid sandy loam, or a well-drained
strong clay, which if it possesses a calcareous, or gravelly
subsoil, will be still more advantageous. It is not requisite
that it should be of so great depth as for pears, as the
apple, having no tap-root, does not penetrate so far into the
soil. From eighteen inches to two feet will be found a
good depth; but where the soil is good, and the subsoil
sufficiently humid without being literally wet, even a foot
to eighteen inches will answer every purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="CLASSIFICATION_OF_APPLES" id="CLASSIFICATION_OF_APPLES">CLASSIFICATION OF APPLES.</a></h2>

<p>A great desideratum in pomological science is, a system of classification
for the apple, founded on characters which are at once permanent
and well defined. The Germans have been most assiduous in endeavoring
to attain this object, and many systems have been suggested, of which
those of Manger, Sickler, Christ, and Diel, are most generally known.
But it is to Diel that the greatest merit is due, for having produced a
system, which, though far from perfect, is greatly in advance of any
which had hitherto been produced; and which has been universally
adopted by all the German pomologists. In 1847, my friend Dochnahl,
an eminent and assiduous pomologist, published a system, based upon
that of Diel, of which it is a modification, and which possesses such advantages
over its type, as to be more easily reduced to practise.</p>

<p>As the systems of Diel and Dochnahl, are certainly the best which
have yet appeared, I have introduced them here, for the benefit of those
who may want a groundwork on which to form an arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h3>DIEL’S CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> RIBBED APPLES.</h4>

<p>1. They are furnished with very prominent, but regular ribs round
the eye, extending also over the fruit, but which do not render the shape
irregular.&mdash;2. Having wide, open, and very irregular cells.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> TRUE CALVILLES.</h5>

<p>1. They taper from about the middle of the fruit towards the eye.&mdash;2.
They are covered with bloom when on the tree.&mdash;3. They have,
or acquire by keeping, an unctuous skin.&mdash;4. They are not distinctly
and purely striped.&mdash;5. They have light, spongy, delicate flesh.&mdash;6.
They have a strawberry or raspberry flavor.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> SCHLOTTERÄPFEL.</h5>

<p>1. The skin does not feel unctuous.&mdash;2. They are not covered with
bloom.&mdash;3. They are either of a flat, conical, cylindrical, or tapering
form.&mdash;4. They have not a balsamic, but mostly a sweetish or sourish
flavor.&mdash;5. They have a granulous, loose, and coarse-grained flesh.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> GULDERLINGE.</h5>

<p>1. They are not balsamic like Order <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>, but of an aromatic flavor.&mdash;2.
They have a fine flesh, almost like that of the Reinettes.&mdash;3. They
are either of a conical or flat shape.&mdash;4. They are most prominently
ribbed round the eye.</p>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> ROSENÄPFEL.&mdash;ROSE APPLES.</h4>

<p>1. They are covered with blue bloom when on the tree.&mdash;2. They
have not unproportionally large, but often only regular cells.&mdash;3. They
emit a pleasant odor when briskly rubbed.&mdash;4. The skin does not feel
unctuous.&mdash;5. They are handsomely and regularly ribbed round the eye,
and often also over the fruit.&mdash;6. They have a tender, loose, spongy,
and mostly fine-grained flesh.&mdash;7. They have a fine rose, fennel, or anise
flavor.&mdash;8. They are mostly of short duration, and are often only
summer, or autumn apples.&mdash;9. They are mostly striped like a tulip.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> FRUIT TAPERING OR OBLONG.</h5>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> FRUIT ROUND OR FLAT.</h5>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> RAMBOURS.</h4>

<p>1. They are all large apples, and comprise the largest sorts.&mdash;2.
They have mostly, or almost always, two unequal halves, namely
one side lower than the other.&mdash;3. They are constantly furnished with
ribs round the eye, which are broad, rising irregularly the one above
the other, and extending over the fruit, so as to render it irregular in its
shape; they are also compressed and have one side higher than the
other.&mdash;4. They are constantly broader than high, and only sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
elongated.&mdash;5. They have all a loose, coarse-grained, and often very
pleasant flesh.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> WITH WIDE CELLS.</h5>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> WITH NARROW CELLS.</h5>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> REINETTES.</h4>

<p>1. They have a fine-grained, delicate, crisp, firm, or tender flesh.&mdash;2.
They are mostly the ideal of a handsome shaped apple; in them
the convexity or bulge of the middle of the apple, towards the eye, is
the same as that towards the stalk, or not much different.&mdash;3. They
are all grey dotted, or have russety patches, or completely covered with
russet.&mdash;4. They have only rarely an unctuous skin.&mdash;5. They have
all the rich, aromatic, sugary, and brisk flavor, which is called the
Reinette flavor&mdash;6. They decay very readily, and must, of all apples,
hang longest on the tree.&mdash;7. The really sweet, and at the same time
aromatic apples, belong to the Reinettes, only as regards their shape,
their russety character, and their fine or firm flesh.&mdash;8. Apples with
fine, firm, crisp flesh, which cannot of themselves form a separate
class,&mdash;for instance, the Pippins also belong to this class.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> SELF COLORED REINETTES.</h5>

<p>1. Having an uniform green ground color, which changes to the
most beautiful golden yellow.&mdash;2. Having no lively colors or marks of
russet on the side next the sun; except those that are very much
exposed, and which assume a slight tinge of red.&mdash;3. Having no
covering of russet, but only slight traces of russety stripes.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> RED REINETTES.</h5>

<p>Having all the properties of the self colored Reinettes, but of a pure
red on the side next the sun, without any mixture of russet.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> GREY REINETTES.</h5>

<p>1. Their ground color is green, changing to dingy dull yellow.&mdash;2.
The coating of russet, or the russety patches spread over the
greater part of the fruit are very conspicious.&mdash;3. The side next the
sun is often dull brownish, or ochreous red.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> GOLDEN REINETTES.</h5>

<p>1. On the side next the sun they are washed, or striped with
beautiful crimson.&mdash;2. The ground color changes by keeping to
beautiful deep yellow.&mdash;3. Over the ground color, and the crimson of
the exposed side, are spread light thin patches, or a complete coat of
russet.</p>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="5">V.</abbr> STREIFLINGE.&mdash;STRIPED APPLES.</h4>

<p>1. They are all, and almost always, marked with broken stripes of
red.&mdash;2. These stripes are found either over the whole fruit, or only
very indistinctly on the side exposed to the sun.&mdash;3. The stripes may
be distinct, that is to say, truly striped; or between these stripes on the
side next the sun, the fruit is dotted, shaded, or washed with red; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
on the shaded side the stripes are well defined.&mdash;4. The cells are
regular.&mdash;5. They are of a purely sweet, vinous, or acid flavor.&mdash;6.
They have not the same flavor as the Rosenäpfel.&mdash;7. They do not
decay except when gathered before maturity, or after the period when
properly ripened.&mdash;8. They form a large and somewhat considerable
class among the culinary fruits.</p>

the stalk, and are broadly flattened.&mdash;2. They are constantly half an
inch broader than high.</p>

<p>1. They are broader than high.&mdash;2. They diminish from the
middle of the apple towards the eye, so that the superior half is conical,
or pyramidal, and is not at all similiar to the inferior half.</p>

<p>1. The height and breath are almost equal.&mdash;2. They diminish
gradually from the base to the apex.&mdash;3. Or from the middle of the fruit,
they gradually diminish towards the base and apex equally.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> ROUND STREIFLINGE.</h5>

<p>1. The convexity of the fruit next the base and the apex is the
same.&mdash;2. The breadth does not differ from the height, except only
about a quarter of an inch.&mdash;3. Laid in the hand with the eye and
stalk sideways, they have the appearance of a roundish shape.</p>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr> TAPERING APPLES.</h4>

<p>1. They have the cells regular.&mdash;2. They are not covered with
bloom.&mdash;3. They are not striped, and are either of an uniform color, or
washed with red on the side next the sun.&mdash;4. Constantly diminishing
to a point towards the eye.&mdash;5. They are sweet, or vinous, approaching
a pure acid.&mdash;6. They do not decay readily.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> TAPERING TO A POINT.</h5>

<p class="center">Characters the same as Order <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> of the Streiflinge.</p>

<h4 title="">CLASS <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> FLAT APPLES.</h4>

striped.&mdash;3. They are either of an uniform color, or on the side
exposed to the sun more or less washed or shaded with red.&mdash;4. They
have regular cells.&mdash;5. They are not unctuous when handled.&mdash;6. They
do not decay readily.&mdash;7. Flavor purely sweet or purely sour.</p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> PURELY FLAT APPLES.</h5>

<p>1. The difference is obvious to the eye.&mdash;2. The breadth is constantly
half an inch more than the height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h5 title="">ORDER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr> ROUND-SHAPED FLAT APPLES.</h5>

<h3 title="CLASSIFICATION OF BRITISH APPLES." class="faux">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Such is the classification of Dochnahl, and although it is not all that
could be desired, it is certainly the best which has yet been published, and
will serve as a good foundation on which to raise a more perfect work.</p>

<p>I have not had an opportunity of applying either of these arrangements
to the classification of our British apples, but for the purpose of affording
a little assistance in identifying the different varieties described in this
work, I have prepared the following, which, although I am aware is not
what could be desired, will at least be sufficient for all general purposes.
The period of duration, and the coloring of fruits, vary to a considerable
extent according to circumstances of soil, situation, and season;
but in the following arrangement, I have endeavored to embrace those
characters which they are most generally found to possess.</p>

<p>An excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; ripe in November,
and will keep under favourable circumstances till March.</p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, and an excellent bearer. It succeeds best in
a dry soil, and is well adapted for espalier training.</p>

<p>This variety is supposed to have originated at the village of Acklam,
in Yorkshire.</p>

Fruit, large, varying from two inches and a half to three inches high
and about the
same in breadth at
the widest part;
pearmain-shaped,
very even, and
regularly formed.
Skin, pale yellow
tinged with green,
and covered with
delicate russet on
the shaded side;
but deep yellow
tinged with red,
and delicately
streaked with livelier
red on the side
next the sun. Eye,
small and open,
with acute erect
segments, set in
a narrow, round,
and plaited basin.
Stalk, varying from
half an inch to an
inch long, obliquely
inserted in a
shallow cavity, and generally with a fleshy protuberance on one side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
it. Flesh, yellowish, crisp, juicy, rich, and sugary, with an agreeable
and pleasantly perfumed flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to February.
It is a large and very handsome variety, and worthy of general
cultivation.</p>

<p>The tree is a free and healthy grower, producing long slender shoots,
by which, and its cucullated ovate leaves, it is easily distinguished. It
is an excellent bearer even in a young state, particularly on the paradise
or doucin stock, and succeeds well as an espalier.</p>

<p>This is one of the largest and best culinary apples. It comes into use
in the beginning of November and continues till April.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, very hardy, and an abundant
bearer.</p>

<p>This variety is supposed to have been raised by a person of the name
of Shepherd, at Uckfield, in Sussex, and has for many years been extensively
cultivated in that county, under the names of <i>Shepherd’s Seedling</i>,
and <i>Shepherd’s Pippin</i>, two names by which it is there most generally
known. Some years ago a Mr. Brooker, of Alfriston, near Hailsham,
in Sussex, sent specimens of the fruit to the London Horticultural
Society, by whom, being unknown, it was called the <i>Alfriston</i>, a name
by which it is now generally known, except in its native county. By
some it is erroneously called the <i>Baltimore</i> and <i>Newtown Pippin</i>.</p>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and
three quarters high; roundish, ribbed on the sides, and almost the same
width at the apex as the base. Skin, yellow tinged with green, and
strewed with brown dots on the shaded side; but with a tinge of brown,
and numerous embedded pearly specks on the side next the sun. Eye,
large and open, with broad, flat segments, set in a wide, deep, and
rather angular basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in
a rather shallow cavity, which is slightly marked with russet. Flesh, yellowish,
slightly tinged with green at the margin, tender, juicy, sugary,
slightly perfumed, and pleasantly flavoured.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of American Apples, this comes to great perfection
in this country, and is a valuable and first-rate culinary apple. It
is ripe in October and will last till Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the true Fall Pippin of the American orchards, and a

</div>

<p>Fruit, small; oblate. Skin, thick, smooth, and shining, yellowish green
in the shade, changing to pale yellow
as it attains maturity; and deep
glossy red, approaching to crimson,
on the side next the sun. Eye, small,
set in a rather deep and plaited
basin. Stalk, short, and deeply inserted.
Flesh, white, crisp, tender,
sweet, very juicy, and slightly perfumed.</p>

<p>A beautiful little dessert apple
in use from October to April.</p>

<p>It should be eaten with the skin on, as it is there that the perfume
is contained. The skin is very sensitive of shade, and any device may
be formed upon it, by causing pieces of paper, in the form of the design
required, to adhere on the side exposed to the sun, before it has attained
its deep red color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The tree is of a pyramidal habit of growth, healthy, and an abundant
bearer. It succeeds well in almost any situation, provided the soil is rich,
loamy, and not too light or dry; and may be grown with equal success
either on the doucin, or crab stock. When worked on the French paradise
it is well adapted for pot culture. The fruit is firmly attached to
the spurs and forcibly resists the effects of high winds.</p>

<p>It has been asserted, that this apple was brought from Peloponessus to
Rome, by Appius Claudius. Whether this be true or not, there can be
no doubt it is of great antiquity, as all the oldest authors regard it as the
production of an age prior to their own. Dalechamp and Harduin are
of opinion that it is the Petisia of Pliny; but J. Baptista Porta considers
it to be the Appiana of that author, who thus describes it, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odor est
his cotoneorum magnitudo quæ Claudianis, color rubens.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> From this
description it is evident that two varieties are referred to, the Appiana
and Claudiana. Such being the case, J. Baptista Porta says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">duo sunt
apud nos mala, magnitudine, et colore paria, et preciosa, quorum unum
odorem servat cotoneorum, alterum minimè. Quod odore caret, vulgo
dictum <i>Melo rosa</i>. Id roseo colore perfusum est, mira teneritudine et
sapore, minimè fugax, pomum magnitudine media, ut facile cum ceteris
de principatu certet, nec indignum Claudii nomine. Hoc Claudianum
dicerem.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> This Melo Rosa may possibly be the Pomme Rose or Gros
Api; and if so, we may infer that the Api is the <i>Appiana</i>, and the Gros
Api the <i>Claudiana</i> of Pliny. This, however, may be mere conjecture,
but as the authority referred to, was a native of Naples, and may be supposed
to know something of the traditionary associations of the Roman
fruits, I have deemed it advisable to record his opinion on the subject.
According to Merlet, the Api was first discovered as a wilding in the
Forest of Api, in Brittany.</p>

<p>Although mentioned by most of the early continental writers, the Api
does not appear to have been known in this country, till towards the end
of the 17th century. It is first mentioned by Worlidge, who calls it
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Pomme Appease, a curious apple, lately propagated; the fruit is small
and pleasant, which the Madams of France carry in their pockets, by
reason they yield no unpleasant scent</span>.” Lister, in his “Journey to
Paris, 1698,” speaking of this as being one of the apples served up in
the dessert, says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Also the Pome d’Apis, which is served here more
for show than for use; being a small flat apple, very beautiful, and very
red on one side, and pale or white on the other, and may serve the
ladies at their toilets as a pattern to paint by.</span>” De Quintinye calls it
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une Pomme des Damoiselles et de bonne compagnie.</span>”</p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Lady Apple</i>, large quantities of the Api are annually
imported to this country from the United States, where it is grown
to a great extent, and produces a considerable return to the growers, as
it always commands the highest price of any other fancy apple in the
market. In the winter months, they may be seen encircled with various
coloured tissue papers, adorning the windows of the fruiterers in Covent
Garden Market.</p>

<p>There are other varieties mentioned by J. B. Porta as belonging to the
Api family; one which ripened in August, in size like the Claudiana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
already mentioned, and commonly called <i>Melo Appio Rosso</i>, because it
retained the scent of the Api; this is probably the Rother Sommer-api
of Diel. There is another, of which he says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Assererem tuto esse Melapium
Plinii</span>,” and which was held in such estimation as to give rise to the
proverb&mdash;</p>

<p>Fruit, below medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches high; oblate. Skin, pale green, changing as it ripens to pale yellow
on the shaded side, and pale red, mottled with green, where exposed

<p>This is a variety of the Api, from which it is distinguished by being very
much flattened, and furnished with five very prominent angles on the

a well-flavored apple, but only of second-rate quality. It ripens about
the middle or end of September.</p>

<p>The variety received under this name by the London Horticultural

<p>Fruit, below medium size; round and flattened, but sometimes considerably
elongated; the general character, however, is shown in the accompanying
figure. Skin, light greenish yellow, covered with yellowish brown
russet, and a tinge of brown next the sun. Eye, small and partially open,
placed in a moderately deep basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a round and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, rich, and highly
aromatic.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of the very first quality, possessing all the richness of
the Nonpareil, but with a more sugary juice. It comes into use in November,
but is in greatest perfection from Christmas till May.</p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, an excellent bearer, and will succeed in situations
unfavorable to the Nonpareil, to which its leaves and shoots bear
such a similarity, as to justify Mr. Lindley in believing it to be a seedling
from that variety.</p>

<p>This delightful apple was raised at Gloucester, about the beginning of
last century, by Dr. Ashmead,
an eminent physician
of that city. The original
tree existed within the last
few years, in what had originally
been Dr. Ashmead’s
garden, but was destroyed in
consequence of the ground
being required for building.
It stood on the spot now occupied
by Clarence Street.
It is difficult to ascertain
the exact period when it was
raised; but the late Mr.
Hignell, an eminent orchardist
at Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, informed me, that the first
time he ever saw the fruit of Ashmead’s Kernel, was from a tree in the
nursery of Mr. Wheeler, of Gloucester, in the year 1796, and that the
tree in question had been worked from the original, and was at that
time upwards of thirty years old. From this it may be inferred that the
original tree had attained some celebrity by the middle of last century.
The Ashmead’s Kernel has long been a favorite apple in all the gardens
of West Gloucestershire, but it does not seem to have been known in
other parts of the country. Like the Ribston Pippin it seems to have
remained long in obscurity, before its value was generally appreciated;
it is not even enumerated in the catalogue of the extensive collection
which was cultivated by Miller and Sweet, of Bristol, in 1790. I find it
was cultivated in the Brompton Park Nursery, in 1780, at which time it
was received from Mr. Wheeler, nurseryman, of Gloucester, who was author
of “The Botanist’s and Gardener’s Dictionary,” published in 1763, and
grandfather of Mr. J. Cheslin Wheeler, the present proprietor of the
nursery, to whom I am indebted for specimens of the fruit, and much
valuable information connected with the varieties cultivated in that
district.</p>

<h3 title="">13. BACHELOR’S GLORY.&mdash;<abbr title="Horticultural Society">H.</abbr></h3>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches wide, and two and three quarters high;
roundish and irregularly ribbed, generally higher on one side of the eye
than the other. Skin, smooth and shining, striped with deep golden
yellow, and crimson stripes. Eye, closed, with broad flat segments, and
set in a plaited, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, about half an
inch long, deeply inserted in a funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined
with rough scaly russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, juicy, and pleasantly
flavored.</p>

<p>A second-rate fruit, suitable either for the dessert or culinary purposes;
in use from October to November.</p>

<p>This is a variety grown in the neighbourhood of Lancaster, where it
is much esteemed, but in the southern districts, where the more choice
varieties can be brought to perfection, it can only rank as a second-rate
fruit.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish or rather oblate, with prominent ribs
on the sides, which terminate in four, and sometimes five considerable
ridges at the crown, very much in the character of the London Pippin.
It is sometimes of an ovate shape, caused by the stalk being prominent
instead of depressed, in which case the ribs on the sides, and ridges
round the eye, are less apparent. Skin, deep lively green, changing as
it ripens to yellowish green, on the shaded side; but covered on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
side next the sun with dull red, which changes to orange where it blends
with the yellow ground;
the whole considerably
marked with thin brown
russet, and russety dots.
Eye, rather large and open,
with short segments, and
set in an angular basin.
Stalk, very short, not more
than a quarter of an inch
long, and inserted in a shallow
cavity. Flesh, greenish
white, firm, crisp, juicy,
sugary, and with a particularly
rich and vinous flavor,
partaking somewhat of the
Nonpareil and Ribston, but particularly the latter.</p>

<p>This is a first-rate dessert apple, in use in November, and possessing
the desirable property of keeping till April or May.</p>

<p>This variety originated in the garden of Mr. John Harris, of Broomfield,
near Chelmsford, and was first introduced to public notice in the
autumn of 1848.</p>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and about three inches high;
ovato-conical. Skin, smooth, yellow on the shaded side; and on the
side next the sun, deep orange, covered with stripes of bright red,
which sometimes extend over the whole surface to the shaded side,
and marked with large russety dots. Eye, closed, set in a deep, narrow,

in a deep cavity, from which issue ramifying patches of russet. Flesh,
yellowish, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly acid, with a rich and agreeable
flavor.</p>

<p>A culinary apple, in season from November to March. The tree is
vigorous, and an abundant bearer; but like the generality of the American
sorts, it does not attain the size, or flavor in this country, which it
does in its native soil.</p>

<p>This is considered one of the finest apples in the Northern States of
America, and is extensively grown in Massachussets, for the supply of the
Boston Market.</p>

formed. Skin, greenish yellow, with a blush and faint streaks of red
next the sun, dotted all over with minute dots, and marked with several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
large spots of rough russet; the base is covered with a coating of russet,
strewed with silvery scales. Eye, large and open, set in a shallow and
plaited basin. Stalk, half an inch long, obliquely inserted by the side of
a fleshy prominence. Flesh, firm, crisp, brisk, juicy, and pleasantly acid,
resembling the Winter Greening in flavor.</p>

<p>It is an excellent culinary apple, in use from November to February;
but as it has nothing to recommend it, in preference to other varieties
already in cultivation, it need only be grown in large collections.</p>

<p>The original tree was produced from a pip, accidentally sown in the
home nursery of Messrs. Ronalds, of Brentford, and from growing on a
bank by the side of a ditch, it was called the <i>Bank Apple</i>.</p>

<p>Fruit, of medium size; oval. Skin, clear pale yellow, mottled with
red in the shade; but
dark red next the sun,
the whole covered with
numerous star-like russety
specks, those on
the shaded side being
brownish, and those
next the sun yellow.
Eye, small and open,
with erect acuminate
segments, and set in a
round, even, and pretty
deep basin. Stalk, about
an inch long, slender,
inserted in a rather
shallow cavity, which
is lined with russet.
Flesh, yellowish white,
firm, crisp, very juicy,
and with a rich, vinous,
and highly aromatic
flavor.</p>

<p>One of the best dessert
apples, and equally
valuable for culinary purposes. It comes to perfection about the end of
November, and continues in use till March.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, but does not attain the largest size. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
very hardy, an abundant bearer, and succeeds well either as a standard
or an espalier.</p>

<p>In the third edition of the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, this is
said to be the same as Reinette Rouge. I do not think that it is the
Reinette Rouge of the French, which Duhamel describes as being white,
or clear yellow in the shade, having often prominent ribs round the
eye, which extend down the sides, so as to render the shape angular; a
character at variance with that of the Barcelona Pearmain. But I have
no doubt of it being the Reinette Rousse of the same author, which is
described at page 302, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1, as a variety of Reinette Franche, and
which he says is of an elongated shape, skin marked with a great
number of russety spots, the most part of which are of a longish figure,
so much so, when it is ripe, it appears as if variegated with yellow and
red; a character in every way applicable to the Barcelona Pearmain.</p>

<p>Fruit, below medium size; in shape somewhat like a Golden Knob,
ovate or conical, with prominent
ribs on the sides,
which terminate in five
ridges round the eye. Skin,
yellowish green, covered
with patches of pale brown
russet, thickly strewed with
large russety freckles, like
the Barcelona Pearmain,
and tinged with orange
next the sun. Eye, small,
partially open, with reflexed
segments, set in a narrow
and angular basin. Stalk,
nearly three quarters of an
inch long, inserted in a
narrow and round cavity.
Flesh, yellowish white, tender,
crisp, brittle, very juicy,
and when eaten is quite a
mouthful of lively, vinous juice.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of the highest excellence, in use from October to
February.</p>

<p>The tree is a good and healthy grower, attains a considerable size,
and is an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>This variety seems to be but little known, and considering its excellence
rarely cultivated. I am not aware that it exists in any of the
nurseries, or that it was at any period extensively propagated. The
only place where I ever met with it was, in the private garden of the
late Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith, whence I procured grafts from a tree in
the last stage of decay.</p>

next the sun. Eye, small and closed, with short segments, and set in a
narrow and angular basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a wide and deep
cavity, which, with the base, is entirely covered with rough brown
russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, and juicy, with a pleasant sub-acid
flavor.</p>

<p>A valuable and now well-known culinary apple, in use from October
to February. When well grown the Beauty of Kent is perhaps the most
magnificent apple in cultivation. Its great size, the beauty of its coloring,
the tenderness of the flesh, and profusion of delicate sub-acid juice,
constitute it one of our most popular winter apples, for culinary purposes,
and one of the most desirable and useful, either for a small garden,
or for more extended cultivation.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attains a large size, and is
a good bearer; but I have always found it subject to canker when grown
on the paradise stock, and in soils which are moist and heavy.</p>

<p>I have not been able to ascertain the time when, or the place where
this variety originated. It is first noticed by Forsyth in his Treatise on
Fruit Trees, but is not enumerated in any of the nurserymen’s catalogues,
either of the last, or the early part of the present, century. It
was introduced to the Brompton Park Nursery, about the year 1820,
and is now as extensively cultivated as most other leading varieties. In
America, Downing says, “the fruit in this climate is one of the most
magnificent of all apples, frequently measuring sixteen or eighteen inches
in circumference.”</p>

<p>This is a very old English variety. It was known to Parkinson so
early as 1629, and also to Worlidge and Ray. But it is not noticed by
any subsequent author, or enumerated in any of the nursery catalogues
of the last century, until discovered by George Lindley, growing in a
garden at Gatton, near Norwich, and published by him in the Transactions
of the London Horticultural Society, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;58. He seems
to be uncertain whether it is the Summer, or Winter Belle Bonne of these
early authors, but Worlidge’s description leaves no doubt as to its identity.
He says “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The Summer Belle et Bonne is a good bearer, but the
fruit is not long lasting. The Winter Belle and Bon is much to be preferred
to the Summer in every respect.</span>” I have no doubt, therefore,

</ul>

<p>Fruit, somewhat long, irregularly shaped, broad at the base, and narrow
at the apex, but sometimes broader at the middle than either of the
extremities. A few obtuse angles terminate at the eye, which is small
and nearly closed, with very short segments. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
and very slender. Skin, dingy colored russety grey in the shade; and
shaded on the sunny side with numerous streaks and patches of orange
color and muddy red.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of the juice is 1073.</p>

<p>This is a good cider apple, and produces liquor of great excellence
when mixed with other varieties. It is chiefly grown in the deep strong
soils of the south-west part of Herefordshire, and is common in the district
known as the Golden Vale. Knight says it was a very old variety,
and was known previous to the 17th century, but I have not been able
to find any record of it in the early works on Pomology.</p>

<p>Fruit, large, the average size smaller than represented in the accompanying
figure, being generally three inches wide, and two and a half
high; globular, and somewhat flattened, broader at the base than the
apex, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin, yellow, with a tinge of

open, with short stunted segments, placed in a round and rather deep
basin. Stalk, short and stout, rather deeply inserted, and scarcely
extending beyond the base. Flesh, yellow, crisp, juicy, sweet, and pleasantly
acid.</p>

<p>A very valuable and highly esteemed apple, either for the dessert or
culinary purposes, but, strictly speaking, more suitable for the latter.
It is in use from November to February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The common complaint against the Blenheim Pippin is, that the tree
is a bad bearer. This is undoubtedly the case when it is young, being of a
strong and vigorous habit of growth, and forming a large and very beautiful
standard; but when it becomes a little aged, it bears regular and
abundant crops. It may be made to produce much earlier, if grafted
on the paradise stock, and grown either as an open dwarf, or an espalier.</p>

<p>This valuable apple was first discovered at Woodstock, in Oxfordshire,
and received its name from Blenheim, the seat of the Duke of Marlborough,
which is in the immediate neighbourhood. It is not noticed in
any of the nursery catalogues of the last century, nor was it cultivated
in the London nurseries till about the year 1818.</p>

<p>The following interesting account of this favorite variety was recently
communicated to the Gardener’s Chronicle. “In a somewhat delapidated
corner of the decaying borough of ancient Woodstock, within
ten yards of the wall of Blenheim Park, stands all that remains of the
original stump of that beautiful and justly celebrated apple, the Blenheim
Orange. It is now entirely dead, and rapidly falling to decay,
being a mere shell about ten feet high, loose in the ground, and having
a large hole in the centre; till within the last three years, it occasionally
sent up long, thin, wiry twigs, but this last sign of vitality has ceased,
and what remains will soon be the portion of the woodlouse and the
worm. Old Grimmett, the basket-maker, against the corner of whose
garden-wall the venerable relict is supported, has sat looking on it from
his workshop window, and while he wove the pliant osier, has meditated,
for more than fifty successive summers, on the mutability of all sublunary
substances, on juice, and core, and vegetable, as well as animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and flesh, and blood. He can remember the time when, fifty years ago,
he was a boy, and the tree a fine, full-bearing stem, full of bud, and
blossom, and fruit, and thousands thronged from all parts to gaze on its
ruddy, ripening, orange burden; then gardeners came in the spring-tide
to select the much coveted scions, and to hear the tale of his horticultural
child and sapling, from the lips of the son of the white-haired
Kempster. But nearly a century has elapsed since Kempster fell, like a
ripened fruit, and was gathered to his fathers. He lived in a narrow
cottage garden in Old Woodstock, a plain, practical, laboring man; and
in the midst of his bees and flowers around him, and in his “glorious
pride,” in the midst of his little garden, he realized Virgil’s dream of
the old Corycian:&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et regum equabat opes animis.</span>”</p>

<p>The provincial name for this apple is still “<i>Kempster’s Pippin</i>,” a
lasting monumental tribute, and inscription, to him who first planted the
kernel from whence it sprang.”</p>

than the base, handsomely and regularly formed, without ribs or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
inequalities. Skin, shining, pale waxen yellow in the shade, and bright
deep red next the sun; it is
strewed with dots, which
are yellowish on the sunny
side, and brownish in the
shade, and marked with
veins and slight traces of
delicate, yellowish-grey
russet. Eye, large and
open, with long reflexed
segments, placed in a rather
deep, round, and pretty
even basin. Stalk, short
and slender, inserted in a
narrow, even, and shallow
cavity, which is lined with
thin russet. Flesh, white
with a yellowish tinge,
crisp and delicate, brisk, juicy, and sugary, and with a rich, vinous, and
aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of the first quality, in use from November to January.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower and very hardy, not subject to canker, and
attains the largest size. It is very prolific when it has acquired its full
growth, which, in good soil, it will do in fifteen or twenty years; and
even in a young state it is a good bearer. If grafted on the paradise
stock it may be grown as an open dwarf, or an espalier. The bloom
is very hardy, and withstands the night frosts of spring better than
most other varieties.</p>

<p>This, above all other apples, is the most highly esteemed in Germany.
Diel calls it the Pride of the Germans. It is believed to have originated
either at a village of Misnia, called Borsdorf, or at a place of the same
name near Leipsic. According to Forsyth, it was such a favorite with
Queen Charlotte, that she had a considerable quantity of them annually
imported from Germany, for her own private use. It is one of the earliest
recorded varieties of the continental authors, but does not seem to have
been known in this country before the close of the last century. It was
first grown in the Brompton Park Nursery in 1785. It is mentioned by
Cordus, in 1561, as being cultivated in Misnia; which circumstance
has no doubt given rise to the synonyme “Reinette de Misnie;” he
also informs us it is highly esteemed for its sweet and generous flavor,
and the pleasant perfume which it exhales. Wittichius, in his “Methodus
Simplicium,” attributes to it the power of dispelling epidemic fevers
and madness!</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches
and a half high; roundish, somewhat flattened, narrowing towards the
apex, and slightly angular. Skin, covered entirely with brownish yellow
russet intermixed with green, and sometimes with a faint tinge of redish
brown next the sun. Eye, closed, set in a round and rather shallow
basin. Stalk, long, slender, and inserted in a moderately deep cavity.
Flesh, yellowish white, juicy, sugary, briskly, and richly flavored.</p>

<p>A very valuable dessert apple, of the first quality, in season from
January to April, and will even keep till June. It partakes much of
the flavor of the Ribston Pippin, and, as a late winter dessert apple, is
not to be surpassed.</p>

<p>The tree is not large, but healthy, very hardy, and an immense bearer,
and, when grafted on the paradise stock, is well suited for being grown
either as a dwarf, or an espalier.</p>

<p>This is an old American variety, and one of the few introduced to this
country which attains perfection in our climate. It is extensively grown
in the neighbourhood of Boston, U.S., both for home consumption and
exportation, and realizes a considerable, and profitable return to the
growers.</p>

roundish and flattened at the ends, with prominent ribs on the sides,
which extend to the eye and form ridges round the apex&mdash;the true
character of the Calvilles. Skin, tender and delicate; when ripe, of a
very pale straw color, and without the least tinge of red on the side
exposed to the sun, but sometimes marked with a few traces of delicate
russet, but no dots. Eye, large, and closed with long, broad, acuminate
segments, and set in a pretty deep and very angular basin. Stalk, three
quarters of an inch long, stout, inserted in a wide and rather shallow
cavity, which is lined with thin russet. Flesh, white, tender, and delicate,
with a sweet and pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>A very good early culinary apple, but not of the finest quality, being
too soft and tender; it is ripe during August, and lasts till the middle of
September.</p>

<p>The tree is a very strong and vigorous grower, with a large round
head, and is an excellent bearer. It is distinguished by its very large
foliage, the leaves being 4½ inches long by 3¼ broad.</p>

<p>This is an old continental variety, but has been very little noticed by
writers on Pomology. It is mentioned in the Jardinier Français, of 1653,
and by De Quintinye, but the first work in which it is either figured
or described, is Knoop’s Pomologie. Duhamel does not notice it, although
it is enumerated in the catalogue of the Chartreuse, from whose garden
he received the materials for producing his work on fruits.</p>

ribs, extending the whole length of the fruit, and terminating at the
apex in prominent unequal ridges. Skin, delicate pale yellow tinged
with green, becoming bright golden yellow at maturity, washed with deep
red on the side next the sun, and strewed with brown dots, and a few
markings of greyish white russet. Eye, small and closed with stout and
pointed segments, set in a deep, irregular, five-ribbed basin, which is
surrounded with knobs. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, slender,
and inserted the whole of its length in a deep and angular cavity, which
is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish white, delicate, and juicy, with a
rich, lively, and agreeable aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>A valuable winter apple, admirably adapted for all culinary purposes,
and excellent also for the dessert. It is in use from January to April.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and a good bearer, but does
not attain more than the middle size. It is rather liable to canker in
damp situations, and is better suited for a dwarf than a standard; if
grown on the paradise stock the appearance of the fruit is very much
improved.</p>

<p>This variety is sometimes called <i>Pomme Glace</i>, which is, however,
a distinct variety, known by the names of <i>Rouge des Chartreux</i>, and
<i>Pomme de Concombre</i>; it is a variety of Calville Blanche d’Hiver, the
fruit is about the size of an egg, but twice as long.</p>

</ul>

<p>Fruit, very large, elongated, and prominently ribbed like the Calville
Blanche d’Hiver, but not so much flattened as that variety. Skin, a
little yellow on the shaded side, and of a beautiful deep red next the
sun, which is marked with stripes of darker red, strewed all over with
minute dots. Eye, small, set in a broad, deep, and angular basin, which
is surrounded with prominent knobs. Stalk, slender, deeply inserted in
an angular cavity. Flesh, white, delicate, very juicy, and charged with
an agreeable acid.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of the first quality; in use from January to April,
and “keeps well.” According to the Chartreux Catalogue, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est bonne
cuite pour les malades</span>.”</p>

<p>The tree is a very vigorous grower, much more so than the generality
of the Calvilles; it is very hardy and an abundant bearer, and is better
adapted for being cultivated as a dwarf than an espalier; but it does not
succeed well on the paradise stock.</p>

<p>According to the French pomologists, this variety seems to have some
connection with this country, but there is no evidence that it was at any
period grown to any extent in England, or that it was ever known to any
of our early pomologists. It is said by some that the name <i>malingre</i> is
applied to this variety from the fruit becoming meally or unsound, but
from the observation in the Chartreux Catalogue, it is more probable
that it is so called from being useful to invalids.</p>

with a trace of yellow on the shaded side, but of a beautiful deep crimson
next the sun, and marked with yellowish dots on the shaded side.
Eye, half open, set in a rather shallow, and ribbed basin, which is
lined with fine down. Stalk, rather short, inserted in a wide and deep
cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, white, tinged with red under
the skin, and very much so on the side which is exposed to the sun; it
is tender, delicate, and juicy, with a pleasant, vinous, and violet scented
flavor.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of inferior quality in this country, but highly
esteemed on the Continent, both as a culinary and a dessert fruit.
It is in season during October and November.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and attains the largest size.
It is also an abundant bearer. To have the fruit in perfection it ought
to be grown on the paradise stock as an open dwarf, in a fine sandy loam,
and not too closely pruned.</p>

<p>Fruit, below medium size; oblate, and ribbed on the sides. Skin,
tough, and bitter tasted, red all over; but of a deeper and darker color
on the side next the sun, and streaked and spotted with paler red on the
shaded side. Eye open, placed in a wide and deep basin. Stalk, long,
inserted in a round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, tender and delicate,
crisp, sweet, and perfumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>This curious apple has the extraordinary property of producing three
crops of fruit in one season. The first flowers appear at the usual
time in April, the second in June, and then for a time it ceases to produce
any more till the month of August, when it again blooms during
the whole of that month, September, October, and November, until
it is checked by the severity of the frosts. The first fruit is generally
ripe during August; the second in October, which are about the
size of a pigeon’s egg, and quite as good as the first. And so on it continues
until retarded by the frosts; but those last produced are rarely
fit for use.</p>

<p>This variety was first brought into notice by M. Thouin, of Paris,
who says the tree originated on the farm of the Baroness de Micoud,
near La Charité sur Loire, in the department of Nièvre.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of the first quality, in use from August to December.
It is one of the most useful as well as one of the best culinary apples we
have, being fit for use when no larger than a walnut, and after perfecting
their growth continuing in perfection as late as Christmas. If blanched in
warm water, when used small, the outer rind slips off, and they may be
baked whole; their color is then a transparent green; and their flavor
is exquisite, resembling that of a green apricot. When it is about the
size of a large nutmeg, it may be made into apple marmalade, or a dried
sweetmeat, which rivals the finest Portugal plum.&mdash;<a href="#M_C_H_S" title="Memoirs Caledonian Horticultural Society" class="ref">M.C.H.S.</a></p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, a free grower, and an abundant bearer. As
it does not attain a great size, it may be grown more closely together
than most other sorts. It is a dwarf variety of the old English Codlin.</p>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter broad, and the same in height;
oblong, nearly as broad at the apex as at the base, with prominent ribs
on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye, and terminate in
several knobs. Skin, smooth and unctuous, pale green; but with a
brownish tinge next the sun, and strewed with minute russety dots.
Eye, large and open, set in a large, angular, and rather deep basin.
Stalk, short, and slender for the size of the fruit, inserted in a shallow
and angular cavity. Flesh, tender, juicy, and sweet, with a pleasant,
acid, and slightly perfumed flavor.</p>

<p>One of our oldest and best culinary apples; it is in use from October
to January.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and attains the largest size,
and though not an abundant bearer during the early period of its growth,
it is much more productive as it becomes aged.</p>

<p>In the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue of Fruits, and also in Lindley’s
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Opening quotation mark added.">“Guide</span> to the Orchard.” This is made synonymous with the Costard of
Ray, which is undoubtedly an error, the Costard being a distinct variety.</p>

<p>The Catshead is one of our oldest varieties, and was always highly
esteemed for its great size. Phillips, in his poem on Cyder, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="p_line">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Why should we sing the Thrift,</div>
  <div class="p_line">Codling or Pomroy, or of pimpled coat</div>
  <div class="p_line">The Russet, or the <i>Cat’s-Head’s</i> weighty orb,</div>

  <div class="p_line">Tho’ these are meet, tho’ after full repast,</div>
  <div class="p_line">Are oft requir’d, and crown the rich dessert.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In Ellis’s “Modern Husbandman,” he says the Catshead is, “a very
useful apple to the farmer, because one of them pared and wrapped
up in dough, serves with little trouble for making an apple-dumpling, so
much in request with the Kentish farmer, for being part of a ready
meal, that in the cheapest manner satiates the keen appetite of the hungry
plowman, both at home and in the field, and, therefore, has now got
into such reputation in Hertfordshire, and some other counties, that it is
become the most common food with a piece of bacon or pickle-pork for
families.”</p>

<p>One of the oldest and best cider apples. Although it is perhaps the

<p>The name is said to be derived from <i>Cocko-Gee</i> signifying <i>Goose-dung</i>.
In Langley’s “Pomona,” it is said, “This fruit is originally
from Ireland, and the cyder much valued in that country. About sixteen
or eighteen years since [1727] it was first brought over, and promoted
about Minehead, in Somersetshire. Some gentlemen of that
county have got enough of it now to make five, six, or eight hogsheads
a year of the cyder; and such as have to spare from their own tables,
sell, I am told, from four to eight pounds a hogshead. The cyder is of
the color of sherry (or rather of French white wine), and every whit as
fine and clear. I have tasted of it from several orchards in Somersetshire.
It hath a more vinous taste than any cyder I ever drank, and as
the sight might deceive a curious eye for wine, so I believe the taste
might pass an incurious palate for the same liquor.”</p>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and the same in
height; ovate, angular on the sides, and ribbed round the eye, somewhat
like a Quoining. Skin, dull green on the shaded side, and brownish
red streaked with brighter red on the side next the sun; some parts
of the surface marked with thin russet. Eye, large and closed, set in a
narrow and angular basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted
in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, rich, and
aromatic.</p>

<p>This is one of our best dessert apples, remarkable for its rich and aromatic
flavor; it is in use from December to May.</p>

<p>The tree is hardy, and a free grower, attaining the middle size, but
not an abundant bearer; it produces its fruit at the extremities of the
last year’s wood, and great care should, therefore, be taken to preserve
the bearing shoots. It succeeds well, grafted on the paradise stock, and
grown as an espalier or an open dwarf.</p>

<p>This valuable apple was brought into notice by Sir Christopher Hawkins,
who sent it to the London Horticultural Society, in 1813. It was
discovered about the beginning of the present century, growing in a cottager’s
garden, near Truro, in Cornwall.</p>

<p>The name July-flower is very often applied to this and some other
varieties of apples, and also to flowers, but it is only a corruption of the
more correct name Gilliflower, which is derived from the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Girofle</span></i>,
signifying a clove, and hence the flower which has the scent of that
spice, is called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Giroflier</span></i>, which has been transformed to <i>Gilliflower</i>.
In Chaucer’s “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Romaunt of the Rose</span>,” he writes it <i><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Gylofre</span></i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no_indent">Turner writes it <i><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Gelower</span></i> and <i><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Gelyfloure</span></i>. The proper name, therefore,
is Gilliflower, and not July-flower, as if it had some reference to the

<p>Fruit, above medium size, two inches and three quarters, or three
inches wide, and three inches and a quarter high; oblong, but narrowing
a little towards the eye, distinctly five-sided, having five prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
ribs on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye, and form
ridges round the crown. Skin, smooth, dull yellowish green, strewed
all over with embedded grey specks. Eye, partially closed with long
acuminate segments, and set in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk,
about a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a round, rather shallow, and
narrow cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, and with a brisk,
and pleasant sub-acid flavor.</p>

<p>An excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality. It is in season from
October to Christmas.</p>

<p>The tree is hardy, a strong and vigorous grower, with strong downy
shoots, and an abundant bearer.</p>

<p>The Costard is one of our oldest English apples. It is mentioned
under the name of “Poma Costard,” in the fruiterers’ bills of Edward
the First, in 1292, at which time it was sold for a shilling a hundred.
The true Costard is now rarely to be met with, but at an early period it
must have been very extensively grown, for the retailers of it were
called Costardmongers, an appellation now transformed into Costermongers.
It is mentioned by William Lawson, in 1597, who, in his quaint
style, says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Of your apple-trees you shall finde difference in growth.
A good Pipping will grow large, and a Costard-tree: stead them on the
north side of your other apples, thus being placed, the least will give
sunne to the rest, and the greatest will shroud their fellowes.</span>”</p>

<p>Modern authors make the Costard synonymous with the Catshead,
chiefly, I think, on the authority of Mr. George Lindley, who has it so
in the “Guide to the Orchard;” but this is evidently an error. All
the early authors who mention both varieties regard them as distinct.
Parkinson describes two varieties of Costard&mdash;the “Gray,” and the
“Greene.” Of the former, he says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">it is a good great apple, somewhat
whitish on the outside, and abideth the winter. The Green Costard
is like the other, but greener on the outside continually.</span>” Ray
describes both the Catshead and Costard as distinct, and Leonard Meager
enumerates three varieties of Costard in his list&mdash;the white, grey,
and red; but which of these is identical with that described above, it is
difficult now to determine.</p>

<p>Some etymologists, and Dr. Johnson among the number, consider this
name to be derived from <i>Cost</i>, a head; but what connection there is
between either the shape or other appearance of this apple, and a head,
more than any other variety, must puzzle any one to discover. Is it
not more probable that it is derived from Costatus (<i>Anglice</i>, costate,
or ribbed), on account of the prominent ribs or angles on its sides?
I think this a much more likely derivation.</p>

<p>Fruit, below medium size; oblato-ovate, regular and handsome. Skin,
when fully ripe, of a fine clear yellow, with bright orange, which sometimes
breaks out in a faint red next the sun, and covered all over
with russety freckles. Eye, large and open, with long, acuminate, and
reflexed segments, set in a wide, shallow, and even basin. Stalk, short
and slender, inserted in a smooth and even cavity, which is lined with
thin russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, crisp, very juicy, rich, and highly

<p>One of the best and most valuable dessert apples, both as regards the
hardiness of the tree,
and the rich and delicious
flavor of the fruit,
which is not inferior to
that of the Golden Pippin.
It is in use from

<p>The tree attains the

hardy, and an abundant
bearer. There is scarcely
any description of soil

It grows well on
the paradise stock, producing fruit much larger than on the crab, but
not of so long duration.</p>

<p>This variety is said to have originated at Court of Wick, in Somersetshire,
and to have been raised from a pip of the Golden Pippin. It is
first mentioned by Forsyth, but I have not been able to discover any

<p>Fruit, medium sized; oblate, regularly and handsomely shaped. Skin,
bright green at first on the shaded side, but changing as it ripens to
clear yellow, marked with traces of russet, and russety dots; but entirely
covered with deep crimson, which is also marked with traces of russet
on the side next the sun, extending even to some portion of the shaded
side. Eye, open, with short segments, which are reflexed at the tips, and
set in a wide, even, and deep basin. Stalk, very short, inserted in a
wide and deep cavity, lined with russet, which extends over a portion
of the base. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, rich, and sugary,
with an abundance of vinous and perfumed juice.</p>

<p>A valuable dessert apple of the first quality; in use from December
to May.</p>

<p>The tree is of small habit of growth, but very hardy and an abundant
bearer. It is well
adapted for espalier
training when
worked on the
paradise stock;
and if grafted on
the Pomme Paradis
of the French,
it may be grown
in pots, in which
it forms a beautiful
and interesting
object when
laden with its
beautiful fruit.</p>

<p>The bloom expands later than that of any other variety, and on that
account is less liable to be injured by spring frosts, hence, according to
Thompson, it has been called the <i>Wise Apple</i>.</p>

<p>This is not the Capendu of Duhamel, as quoted by Lindley and Downing;
neither is it the Court-pendu of Forsyth and De Quintinye, that
variety being the Fenouillet Rouge of Duhamel, <i>see  <a href="#NO_123" title="Number 123" class="ref">No. 123</a></i>. The
Courpendu of Miller is also a different apple from any of those just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mentioned, and is distinguished by having a long and slender stalk, “so
that the fruit is always hanging downwards.” The name of this variety is
derived from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps pendu</span></i> translated by some <i>Hanging Body</i>, whereas
that of the variety above described, is from <i>Court pendu</i>, signifying <i>suspended
short</i>, the stalk being so short, that the fruit, sits, as it were,
upon the branch. The name Capendu or Capendua, is mentioned by
the earliest authors, but applied to different varieties of apples. It is
met with in Ruellius, Tragus, Curtius, and Dalechamp, the latter considering
it the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cestiana</span></i> of Pliny. Curtius applies the name to a yellow
apple, and so also does Ruellius; but Tragus considers it one of the
varieties of Passe-pomme, he says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capendua magna sunt alba et dulcia,
in quorum utero semina per maturitatem sonant, Ruellio <i>Passipoma</i> apellantur.</span>”
They are also mentioned by J. Bauhin, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celeberrimum hoc
pomi genus est totius Europæ, sic dicta, quòd ex curto admodum pendeant

<p>Fruit, rather below medium size; oblate, and sometimes a little
angular in its outline.
Skin, smooth and shining,
entirely covered with deep
purplish red, except where
it is shaded by a leaf or
twig, and then it is of a
delicate pale green, presenting
a clear and well-defined
outline of the object
which shades it. Eye,
quite closed, with very
long tomentose segments,
and placed in an undulating
and shallow basin,
which is sometimes knobbed,
and generally lined
with thick tomentum.
Stalk, about three quarters of an inch long, fleshy at the insertion,
deeply set in a round and funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white tinged
with green, crisp, brisk, and very juicy, with a rich vinous, and refreshing
flavor.</p>

<p>A very valuable and first-rate dessert apple. It ripens on the tree
the first week in August, and lasts till the end of September. It is one
of the earliest summer dessert apples, and at that season, is particularly
relished, for its fine, cooling, and refreshing, vinous juice.</p>

<p>The tree attains a considerable size, it is particularly hardy, and a
most prolific bearer. It succeeds well in almost every soil and situation,
and is admirably adapted for orchard planting. In almost every latitude
of Great Britain, from Devonshire to the Moray Frith, I have observed
it in perfect health and luxuriance, producing an abundance of well
ripened fruit, which, though not so large, nor so early in the northern
parts, still possessing the same richness of flavor as in the south.</p>

<p>This is supposed to be a very old variety, but there is no record of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
previous to 1693, when it is mentioned by Ray; and except by Mortimer,
it is not noticed by any subsequent writer till within a very recent
period. It seems to have been unknown to Switzer, Langley, and Miller;
nor do I find that it was grown in any of the London nurseries before
the beginning of the present century. The only early catalogue in which
I find it is that of Miller and Sweet, of Bristol, in 1790.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; conical, more long than broad, eight or nine
inches in circumference, a little angular on the sides. Eye, small, in a
rather wide and oblique basin. Stalk, half an inch long, deeply inserted.
Skin, yellowish-green, with several redish spots; on the sunny side

shallow cavity which is lined with delicate russet. Flesh, yellowish
white, delicate, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a rich, brisk, vinous and
somewhat aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of first-rate quality, resembling the Golden Pippin
both in size, shape, and color, as well as flavor. It is in use from
November to January.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong, healthy, and vigorous grower, a most abundant
bearer, and attains about the middle size. It may be grown as an open
dwarf, and is well suited for espaliers. The fruit is also valuable for the
cider it produces, the specific gravity of the juice being 1080.</p>

<p>This excellent variety was raised by Thomas Andrew Knight, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,

brown russet, which is strewed with rougher russety freckles, and tinged

firm, brisk, juicy, sugary, and richly flavored.</p>

<p>An excellent apple for culinary purposes, and even worthy of the
dessert. It is in use from December to March.</p>

<p>This, with the following variety, was either raised or first brought
into notice, by a Mr. William Dredge, of Wishford, near Salisbury. In
a letter dated November, 1802, which is in my possession, he writes to
the late Mr. Forsyth with specimens of these varieties, and of this he

with patches of thin russet, and large russety dots, particularly over the
base; and mottled with pale red on the side exposed to the sun. Eye,
closed, set in a deep and angular basin. Stalk, about three quarters of
an inch long, inserted in a deep cavity which is lined with russet. Flesh,
greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, brisk, and sugary, with a rich aromatic
flavor.</p>

<p>This is a valuable and very excellent apple, suitable either for dessert
use, or culinary purposes. It is in use from December to March. In
his letter to Mr. Forsyth, referred to above, Mr. Dredge says, “This is
the best apple yet known; in eating from Easter till Midsummer&mdash;most
excellent.”</p>

<p>The tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, an early and abundant bearer,
but according to Rogers, liable to be attacked by the woolly aphis;
still I have never found it more susceptible of that disease than most
other varieties.</p>

<p>There are several other varieties mentioned by Forsyth as <i>seedlings</i>
of Dredge’s, which I have not met with, as Dredge’s Queen Charlotte,
Dredge’s Russet, and Dredge’s Seedling. I have also in my collection,
Dredge’s Emperor and Lord Nelson, both of which are grown in the
West of England, but I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the
fruit. It is, however, a question whether these are really seedlings of
Dredge’s or not; there are several varieties to which he affixed his name,
which have been ascertained to be identical with others that existed
before him, such as Dredge’s White Lily, which is synonymous with
Devonshire Buckland, and Dredge’s Beauty of Wilts, which is the same
as Harvey’s Pippin. Such instances tend to weaken our faith in the high
encomium passed upon him, by Rogers, of Southampton, in the “Fruit
Cultivator,” and induce us to class him with those who not only change
the name of some varieties, and append their own to others under the
pretence of their being new, and seedlings of their own, but dispose of
them at greater prices than they could have procured, had they been sold
under their correct names. We have but to glance over the Horticultural
Society’s Catalogue, or the Index to this work, to find numerous instances
confirmatory of this statement.</p>

<p>Fruit, large; roundish and flattened. Skin, pale yellow, strewed with
minute russety dots, and greenish embedded specks under the surface and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with a tinge of pale red on the side next the sun, which is sometimes
almost entirely covered with a bright red cheek. Eye, large and open,
with broad, reflexed, acuminate segments, set in an irregular, uneven,
and pretty deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, deeply inserted in a
narrow, and funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,
yellowish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, and very juicy, with a slight aromatic
flavor.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable culinary apples; it is in use from November
to March.</p>

<p>The tree is one of the strongest, and most vigorous growers, very
hardy, and an excellent bearer. The young shoots which are long and
stout, are thickly covered with large greyish white dots, which readily
distinguish this variety from almost every other.</p>

<p>This excellent apple was raised by a person of the name of Dumeller,
(pronounced <i>Dumelow</i>), a farmer at Shakerstone, a village in Leicestershire,
six miles from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and is extensively cultivated in
that, and the adjoining counties under the names of Dumelow’s Crab.
It was first introduced to the neighbourhood of London, by Mr. Richard
Williams, of the Turnham Green Nursery, who received it from Gopsal
Hall, the seat of Earl Howe, and presented specimens of the fruit to the
Horticultural Society in 1820. It was with him that the name of Wellington
Apple originated, and by which only it is now known in the
London markets.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish, even and handsomely shaped, narrowing
a little towards
the apex,
where it is sometimes
slightly
ribbed. Skin,
dull greenish-yellow,
marked
all over with
broken streaks
of pale red and
crimson, with
traces of russet,

Stalk, an inch long, inserted in a round and deep cavity, which,
with a portion of the base, is lined with rough russet. Flesh, yellow,
firm, crisp, very juicy, rich, sugary, and aromatic.</p>

<p>A very valuable and delicious dessert apple; in use from December
to April.</p>

<p>The tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, and a very abundant bearer.
It attains about the middle size when fully grown. The shoots are thickly
set with fruit spurs. It is well adapted for dwarf or espalier training, and
for these purposes succeeds well on the paradise stock.</p>

<p>Fruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; round. Skin, smooth, pale yellowish-green
at first, but changing to clear pale yellow as it ripens, and set with embedded
white specks, particularly round the eye. Eye, small and closed,
set in a round and shallow basin. Stalk, half an inch long, inserted in
a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a
quick and pleasantly sub-acid flavor, and as is justly remarked by Mr.
Thompson, “closely approximates that of the Newtown Pippin, of perfect
American growth.”</p>

<p>An estimable and refreshing early dessert apple, of the first quality;
ripe in the end of July and the beginning of August.</p>

<p>The tree is a healthy, and free, though not a vigorous grower, and an
abundant bearer. It is well adapted for dwarf or espalier training when
grown on the paradise stock, and ought to find a place in every collection
however small.</p>

<p>Though of American origin this variety succeeds to perfection in this

ribbed from the eye downwards to the base. Skin, smooth, pale yellow,
with an orange tinge next the sun, strewed all over with minute dots

a deep, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, short, not extending beyond
the base, and inserted in a deep and angular cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white,
crisp, very juicy, and with a brisk, pleasant, and refreshing flavor.</p>

<p>An excellent early culinary apple, of first-rate quality, ripe in the
second week of August. It might with propriety be called the Summer
Hawthornden, as it equals that esteemed old variety in all its
properties.</p>

<p>The tree is healthy and hardy, but not a large grower. It is, however,
a good bearer, though not so much so as the Hawthornden, and is well
adapted for growing as a dwarf.</p>

<p>This variety is said to be of Scotch origin, but I cannot ascertain
where, or when it was first discovered. It is not mentioned by Gibson,
neither is it enumerated in the catalogue of Leslie and Anderson, of
Edinburgh, or any of the Scotch nurserymen of the last century. It
was first introduced to the south by the late Mr. Hugh Ronalds, of Brentford,
who exhibited it at the London Horticultural Society.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; somewhat oblato-ovate. Skin, dull yellow,
covered with thin
brownish grey russet,
and marked with large
russety dots. Eye,
open, placed in a
small, round, and rather
shallow basin.
Stalk, half-an-inch
long, inserted in a

russety cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white, tender,

sugary, with a brisk
and rich aromatic flavor,
resembling the
old Nonpareil.</p>

<p>A delicious apple
for the dessert, and of the first quality; it is in use during October and
November, after which it becomes dry and meally.</p>

<p>The tree is a free and upright grower, perfectly hardy, an early and
abundant bearer; even in the nursery quarters it produces freely when
only two years from the graft. It is well adapted for dwarf and espalier
training, when grown on the paradise stock.</p>

<p>This esteemed variety was raised about the year 1780, by a nurseryman
of the name of Stagg, at Caister, near Yarmouth, in Norfolk. The
name of Hicks’s Fancy was given to it by Kirke, formerly a nurseryman
at Brompton, near London, from the circumstance of a person of
the name of Hicks, giving it the preference to the other varieties which
were fruited in the nursery. An instance of the absurd system by which
the names of fruits have been multiplied.</p>

flavor.</p>

<p>A beautiful and valuable apple, both as regards its size and quality.
It is more adapted for culinary than dessert use, but is also desirable
for the latter were it only on account of its noble appearance at the
table. It is in use from September to December.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, producing long stout shoots,
is perfectly hardy and a good bearer.</p>

<p>This apple was introduced to this country by Mr. Lee, nurseryman
of Hammersmith, in 1817, and was exhibited by him at the London
Horticultural Society; the specimen produced being five inches and a
half in diameter, four inches deep, sixteen inches in circumference, and
weighed nineteen ounces. It is generally supposed that this was its first
appearance in England; but there can be little doubt that it is the
<i>Ph&#339;nix Apple</i> figured by Brookshaw, whose account of it in 1808, is as
follows:&mdash;“It was much grown fifty years back in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Twickenham, but was rather lost. The late Mr. Ash, nurseryman at
Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, preserved it from his father, who
had an old tree of it. This specimen came from that tree. This apple
was seen in Russia by an English nobleman, who thought it so excellent
an apple, that he was induced to send some trees of it to England, and
what will appear extraordinary to English gardeners, they were taken up
in the summer with their leaves on, when they could not be less than
twelve years old by their appearance, and when they arrived, after being
six months before they came to hand, they were planted and produced
fruit, and are now fine trees. The apple has a bloom on it like a red
plum when on the tree, and is a very excellent beautiful apple, ripens in
October, and will keep through December. It is to be had at the late
Mr. Ash’s nursery, at Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, under the
name of Ph&#339;nix Apple, from its being lost and revived.”</p>

<p>The trees are excellent bearers, but in most orchards they are generally
found unhealthy, cankered, and full of the woolly aphis, a state produced,
according to Mr. Lindley, by their being raised from suckers, and
truncheons stuck into the ground. In the “Guide to the Orchard,”
he says, “Healthy, robust, and substantial trees are only to be obtained
by grafting on stocks of the real Sour Hedge Crab; they then grow
freely, erect, and form very handsome heads, yielding fruit as superior
to those of our old orchards, as the old, and at present deteriorated Codlin
is to the Crab itself.” This circumstance was noticed by Worlidge
nearly two hundred years ago&mdash;“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">You may graft them on stocks as you
do other fruit, which will accelerate and augment their bearing; but
you may save that labor and trouble, if you plant the Cions, Slips, or
Cuttings of them in the spring-time, a little before their budding; by
which means they will prosper very well, and soon become Trees; but
these are more subject to the canker than those that are grafted.</span>”</p>

<p>This is one of our oldest English apples, and still deserving of more
general cultivation than is at present given to it. Formerly it constituted
one of the principal dishes in English cookery, in the shape of
“Codlings and Cream.” Ray says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crudum vix editur ob duritiem
et aciditatem, sed coctum vel cum cremore lactis, vel cum aqua rosacea
et saccharo comestum inter laudatissima fercula habetur.</span>” The name is
derived from <i>coddle</i>, to parboil.</p>

<p>A most excellent dessert apple; in use from November to February.</p>

<p>This is a native of the United States, and is there considered one of
the best dessert apples. Along with the Newtown Pippin it ranks as one
of the most productive and profitable orchard fruits, but like many, and
indeed almost all the best American varieties, it does not attain to that
degree of perfection in this country that it does in its native soil. The
tree is tender and subject to canker, and the fruit lacks that high flavor,
and peculiar richness which characterizes the imported specimens. It
was raised at Esopus, on the Hudson, where it is still grown to a large
extent.</p>

greenish-yellow as it ripens, and occasionally tinged with a cloud of thin
dull red on the side exposed to the sun, and thinly strewed with a few
dots. Eye, closed, with long and downy segments, set in a narrow and
ribbed basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch to an inch in length, slender,
and inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with russet.
Flesh, white, tender, and marrowy, juicy, and briskly flavored.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of second-rate quality; in use during October and
November.</p>

<p>It is much grown in the Berkshire orchards.</p>

<p>Fruit, large; roundish, and considerably flattened, with obtuse angles
on the sides, which extend into the basin of the eye, where they form
prominent knobs on the apex. Skin, greenish-yellow, thickly strewed
with green dots on the shaded side; but next the sun, dull red marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
with patches and streaks of livelier red, and dotted with light grey dots.
Eye, large and open, with broad reflexed segments, and placed in a large
angular basin, which is marked with russet. Stalk, an inch long, thick
and strong, deeply set in an angular cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, firm,
crisp, and juicy, with a pleasant and briskly acid flavor.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to
January.</p>

<p>The tree is a pretty good bearer, one of the strongest and most vigorous
growers, and consequently more suitable for the orchard than the
fruit garden.</p>

<p>Fruit, below medium size; roundish, inclining to oblate, regularly

obtuse segments, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, very short,

<p>Specific gravity of the juice from 1076 to 1081.</p>

<p>This is a fine old Gloucestershire cider apple, which is extensively
cultivated on the thin limestone soils of the Forest of Dean. The cider
that it produces is strong bodied, rich, and highly flavored.</p>

<p>The tree produces numerous straight, luxuriant, upward shoots, like
a pollard willow; it runs much to wood, and in deep soils attains a considerable
size before it becomes fruitful.</p>

inch long, inserted in a small, round, and shallow cavity, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with thick russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, mellow, juicy, sweet,
and finely perfumed.</p>

<p>A beautiful and valuable apple, suitable either for the dessert, culinary
use, or for the manufacture of cider. It is in use from October to
January.</p>

<p>The tree attains about the middle size, is perfectly hardy and healthy,
and quite free from canker and disease. It is a most abundant and
regular bearer.</p>

<p>I am surprised that this beautiful apple has hitherto escaped the
notice of pomologists, it being so universally grown, and generally
popular, in the district to which it belongs. In the north-eastern parts
of Sussex, and the adjoining county of Surrey, it is extensively cultivated,
and I believe there is scarcely a cottager’s garden where it is
not to be met with, nor is there a cottager to whom its name is not
as familiar as his own, it being considered to supply all the qualifications
that a valuable apple is supposed to possess; and although this
judgment is formed in contrast with the other varieties grown in the
district, nevertheless, the Forge is a useful and valuable apple, particularly
to a cottager, whether we consider its great productiveness, its uses as a
dessert and excellent cooking apple, or the excellent cider which it produces.
It is said to have originated at a blacksmith’s forge near East
Grinstead.</p>

in a wide and slightly furrowed basin. Stalk, short and stout, inserted
in a deep and open cavity, which is lined with rough russet. Flesh,
white, tender, juicy, and though not highly flavored, is an excellent
culinary apple.</p>

<p>It is in use from October to Christmas.</p>

<p>This variety is of American origin, but some doubts exist as to where
it was first raised, that honor being claimed by several different localities.
The general opinion, however, is, that it originated in the garden
of a Mr. Smith, in the neighbourhood of Baltimore, and was first brought
over to this country by Captain George Hudson, of the ship Belvedere,
of Baltimore, in 1817. It was introduced from America into France by
Comte Lelieur, in 1804. But from the account given in the Allgemeines
Teutsches Gärtenmagazin, it is doubtful whether it is a native of America,
for in the volume of that work for 1805, it is said to have been
raised by Herr Künstgartner Maszman, of Hanover. If that account is
correct, its existence in America is in all probability owing to its having
been taken thither by some Hanoverian emigrants. At page 41, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr>,

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a half wide, and over two inches and
three quarters high; ovate, somewhat of the shape of Emperor Alexander,
ribbed on the sides, and terminated round the eye by a number
of puckered-like knobs. Skin, dull greenish-yellow, with numerous
embedded whitish specks, particularly round the eye, and covered with
large dark russety dots, and linear marks of russet; but on the side
exposed to the sun it is of a deeper yellow, with a few broken streaks
and dots of crimson. Eye, small and slightly closed, set in a shallow
and puckered basin. Stalk, short and fleshy, inserted in a wide, deep,
and russety cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, soft, juicy, sprightly,

ribbed on the sides. Skin, smooth and shining, yellow, mixed in some
parts with a tinge of green, and washed with thin clear red on the side
next the sun; the whole surface is strewed with minute russety dots,
and several large dark spots, such as are often met with on the Hawthornden.
Eye, large, with long segments, and set in an angular basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep cavity, which is
surrounded with a large patch of rough grey russet. Flesh, yellowish-white,
firm but tender, very juicy, with a pleasant, brisk, and slightly
perfumed flavor.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of first quality; it is in use the end of October and
continues till Christmas.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attaining a great size,
and is an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>I had this variety from Mr. James Lake, of Bridgewater, and it is
evidently identical with the Glory of the West of Diel, a name which,
according to Lindley, is sometimes applied to the Dutch Codlin. The
variety here described bears a considerable resemblance to that known

<p>This is one of the richest
and most excellent dessert
apples; it is in use from December
to May; but is very
apt to shrivel if exposed to

apples are.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower,
and perfectly hardy. It attains
about the middle size and is an excellent bearer. When grown on
the paradise stock it is well adapted for dwarf training, and forms a good
espalier.</p>

<p>Independently of being one of the best dessert apples, it is also one of
the best for cider; and from the great strength of its juice, the specific

Stalk, from half-an-inch to an
inch in length, inserted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
pretty deep cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very juicy and sugary,
with a brisk, vinous, and particularly fine flavor.</p>

<p>One of the oldest and by far the most highly esteemed of our dessert
apples, and neither the Borsdorffer of the Germans, the Reinette of the
French, nor the Newtown Pippin of the Americans, will ever occupy in
the estimation of the English the place now accorded to the Golden Pippin.
It is also an excellent cider apple. The specific gravity of its juice
is 1078.</p>

<p>It is in season from November to April.</p>

<p>The tree is a free and vigorous grower, but does not attain a great
size. It is also an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>When and where the Golden Pippin was first discovered, are now matters
of uncertainty; but all writers agree in ascribing to it an English origin,
some supposing it to have originated at Parham Park, near Arundel,
in Sussex. Although it is not recorded at so early a period as some others,
there is no doubt it is a very old variety. It is not, however, the “Golding
Pippin” of Parkinson, for he says “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">it is the <i>greatest</i> and best of all sorts
of Pippins</span>.” It was perhaps this circumstance that led Mr. Knight to
remark, that from the description Parkinson has given of the apples cultivated
in his time, it is evident that those now known by the same
names, are different, and probably new varieties. But this is no evidence
of such being the case, for I find there were two sorts of Golden Pippin,
the “Great Golding,” and the “Small Golding, or Bayford,” both of
which are mentioned by Leonard Meager, and there is no doubt the
“Golding Pippin,” of Parkinson, was the “Great Golding.” Whether
it was because it was little known, or its qualities were unappreciated,
that the writers of the 17th century were so restrictive in their praises
of the Golden Pippin, it is difficult to say; but true it is whilst Pearmains,
Red Streaks, Codlings, and Catsheads, are set forth as the desiderata
of an orchard, the Golden Pippin is but rarely noticed. Ralph Austin
calls it “a very speciall apple and great bearer.” Evelyn certainly
states that Lord Clarendon cultivated it, but it was only as a cider apple:
for he says “at Lord Clarendon’s seat at Swallowfield, Berks, there is an
orchard of 1000 Golden <i>and other cider</i> Pippins.” In his Treatise on
Cider he frequently notices it as a cider apple; but never in any place
that I can recollect of as a dessert fruit. In the Pomona, he says,
“About London and the southern tracts, the Pippin, and especially the
Golden, is esteemed for making the most delicious cider, most wholesome,
and most restorative.” Worlidge merely notices it as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">smaller
than the Orange Apple, else much like it in color, taste, and long keeping</span>.”
Ray seems the first who fully appreciated it, for after minutely
and correctly describing it, he says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad omnes culinæ usus præstantissimum
habetur, et Pomaceo conficiendo egregium</span>.” De Quintinye’s
remarks are not at all complimentary. He says it has altogether the
character of the paradise or some other wild apple, it is extremely yellow
and round, little juice, which is pretty rich, and without bad flavor.
But the Jardinier Solitaire, more impartial, or with better judgment,
says, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">son eau est tres sucrée; elle a le goût plus relevé que la Reynette;
c’est ce que luy donne le mérite d’être reconnuë pour une tres excellente
pomme</span>.” The opinion of Angran de Rueneuve is also worth recording.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Pomme d’Or est venuë d’Angleterre; on l’y apelle Goule-Pepin.
J’estime qu’elle doit être la Reyne des Pommes, et que la Reynette ne
doit marche qu’aprés elle; car elle est d’un plus fin relief que toutes
les autres Pommes.</span>” Switzer calls it “the most antient, as well as most
excellent apple that is.” But it is not my intention to record all that
has been written in praise of the Golden Pippin, for that of itself would
occupy too much space, my object in making these extracts being simply
to show the gradual progress of its popularity.</p>

<p>The late President of the London Horticultural Society, T. A. Knight,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, considered that the Golden Pippin, and all the old varieties of
English apples, were in the last stage of decay, and that a few years
would witness their total extinction. This belief he founded upon the
degenerate state of these varieties in the Herefordshire orchards, and
also upon his theory that no variety of apple will continue to exist more
than 200 years. But that illustrious man never fell into a greater error.
It would be needless to enter into any further discussion upon a subject
concerning which so much has already been said and written, as there is
sufficient evidence to confute that theory. The Pearmain, which is the
oldest English apple on record, shows no symptoms of decay, neither
does the Catshead, London Pippin, Winter Quoining, or any other variety;
those only <i>having been allowed to disappear</i> from our orchards, which
were not worth perpetuating, and their places supplied by others infinitely
superior.</p>

<p>It is now considerably upwards of half a century since this doctrine
was first promulgated, and though the old, exhausted, and diseased trees
of the Herefordshire orchards, of which Mr. Knight spoke, together with
their <i>diseased</i> progeny&mdash;now that they have performed their part, and
fulfilled the end of their existence&mdash;may ere this have passed away, we
have the Golden Pippin still, in all the luxuriance of early youth, where
it is found in a soil congenial to its growth; and exhibiting as little
symptoms of decay as any of the varieties which Mr. Knight raised to
supply the vacancy he expected it to create.</p>

<p>In the Brompton Park Nursery, where the same Golden Pippin has
been cultivated for nearly two centuries, and continued from year to
year by grafts taken from young trees in the nursery quarters, I never
saw the least disposition to disease, canker, or decay of any kind; but,
on the contrary, a free, vigorous, and healthy growth.</p>

<p>But this alarm of Mr. Knight for the safety of the Golden Pippin, and
his fear of its extinction, were based upon no new doctrine, for we find
Mortimer a hundred years before, equally lamenting the Kentish Pippin.
After speaking of manures, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, for the regeneration of fruit trees, he
says, “I shall be glad if this account may put any upon the trial of
raising that excellent fruit the Kentish Pippin, which else, I fear, will
be lost. For I find in several orchards, both in Kent, Essex, and Hertfordshire,
old trees of that sort, but I can find no young ones to prosper.
A friend of mine tried a great many experiments in Hertfordshire, about
raising them, and could never get them to thrive, though he had old
trees in the same orchard that grew and bore very well. I likewise tried
several experiments myself, and have had young trees thrive so well,
as to make many shoots of a yard long in a year, but these young shoots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
were always blasted the next year, or cankered; which makes me think
that the ancients had some particular way of raising them, that we have lost
the knowledge of.” Although this was written a hundred and fifty years
ago, we have the Kentish Pippin still, which though not so much cultivated,
or so well known now as then, is nevertheless where it does exist
as vigorous and healthy as ever it was.</p>

<p>A fine old dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from November

<p>The tree is healthy, vigorous, and an abundant bearer. It requires a
light and warm soil, and is well adapted for dwarf training when worked
on the paradise stock. Large quantities of this fruit are grown in the
counties round London for the supply of the different markets, where
they always command a high price.</p>

<p>This variety has been long known in this country and esteemed as one
of the finest apples. Worlidge, in 1676, says, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">It is to be preferred in
our plantations for all occasions.</span>” Ellis, in his “Modern Husbandman,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
1744, says, “The Golden Rennet, when of the largest sort, may
be truly said to be the farmer’s greatest favorite apple, because when all
others miss bearing, this generally stands his friend, and bears him large
quantities on one tree.”</p>

thin pale brown russet mixed with a tinge of green. Flesh, yellowish-white,

aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>A beautiful and very handsome apple of first-rate quality, and suitable

any situation.</p>

<p>This variety was first brought into notice by Mr. Kirke, a nurseryman,
at Brompton, under the name of <i>King of the Pippins</i>. I have,
however, thought it advisable to discontinue that name in connection
with this variety, because Diel previously possessed and described it
under the name of <i>Golden Winter Pearmain</i>, which is much more appropriate;
and the name of King of the Pippins belongs to another and
very distinct variety.&mdash;<i>See <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 199</i>.</p>

rich, vinous, and powerful aromatic flavor; and if held up between the
eye and the light, with the hand placed on the margin of the basin of the
eye, it exhibits a transparency like porcelain.</p>

<p>This is a very valuable apple of the first quality, and is equally desirable

<p>Specific gravity of its juice 1081.</p>

<p>This is a most excellent cider apple; the liquor it produces being
remarkable for its strength, richness, and high flavor. It requires, however,
to be grown in certain situations; a dry soil with a calcareous
subsoil, being considered the best adapted for producing its cider in
perfection. Marshall says, “It was raised from seed by Mr. Bellamy,
of Hagloe, in Gloucestershire, grandfather of the present Mr. Bellamy,
near Ross, in Herefordshire, who draws from it (that is, from trees grafted
with scions from this parent stock) a liquor, which for richness, flavor,
and <i>pure on the spot</i>, exceeds perhaps every other fruit liquor which
nature and art have produced. He has been offered sixty guineas for a
hogshead (about 110 gallons) of this liquor. He has likewise been offered
bottle for bottle of wine, or spirituous liquors, the best to be produced;
and this without freight, duty, or even a mile of carriage to enhance its

small, very slightly depressed, and surrounded with several prominent
plaits. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in an uneven and deep cavity.
Flesh, white, firm, crisp, juicy, pleasantly acid, and perfumed.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of first-rate quality, well-known and extensively cultivated
in Norfolk; it is in use from October to January.</p>

<p>The tree is large, hardy, and a great bearer.</p>

<p>In the Guide to the Orchard, it is said, “When baked in an oven
which is not too hot, these apples are most excellent; they become
sugary, and will keep a week or ten days, furnishing for the dessert a
highly flavored sweetmeat.”</p>

<p>This is one of the oldest English apples. It is first mentioned by
Parkinson as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a faire, greate, goodly apple; and very well rellished</span>.”
Ralph Austen calls it “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a very choice fruit, and the trees beare well</span>.”
Indeed it is noticed by almost all the early authors. According to Ray
it is named in honor of Dr. Gabriel Harvey, of Cambridge, “Pomum
Harveianum ab inventore Gabriele Harveio Doctore nomen sortitum
Cantabrigiæ suæ deliciæ.”</p>

<p>Fruit, of the largest size; conical, and very handsomely shaped, distinctly
five-sided, having five prominent and acute angles descending
from the apex, till they are lost in the base. Skin, fine deep sulphur yellow;
of a deeper shade on the side which is exposed to the sun, and
covered all over with minute russety dots, with here and there ramifying
patches of russet. Eye, pretty large and open, with short ragged segments,
and set in a rather shallow and angular basin. Stalk, very short,
about half-an-inch long, and not extending beyond the base, inserted in
a round and deep cavity, lined with rough scaly russet, which branches
out over a portion of the base. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, and juicy,
sugary, vinous, and richly flavored. Core, very small for the size of the
apple.</p>

<p>A very handsome and most desirable apple, being of first-rate quality,
either as a dessert or culinary fruit; it is in use from the end of October
to the beginning of January.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>This variety seems to be comparatively little known; but it is well
deserving the notice either of the fruit gardener, or the orchardist; to the
latter particularly so, as its size, fine appearance, and handsome shape
make it attractive at market; and its solid and weighty flesh give it an
advantage over many apples of its size.</p>

<p>Fruit, varying very much in size, according to the situation and condition
of the tree; sometimes it is very large, and again scarcely attaining
the middle size; generally, however, it is above the medium size;
roundish and depressed, with occasionally a prominent rib on one side,
which gives it an irregularity in its appearance. Skin, smooth, covered
with a delicate bloom; greenish-yellow, with a blush of red on one side,
which varies in extent and depth of color according as it has been more
or less exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, with broad and flat
segments, placed in a pretty deep and irregular basin. Stalk, short,
stout, and sometimes fleshy, inserted in a deep and irregular cavity.
Flesh, white, crisp, and tender, very juicy, with an agreeable and pleasant
flavor.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable and popular apples in cultivation. It is suitable
only for kitchen use, and is in season from October to December.</p>

<p>The tree is very healthy and vigorous, and as an early and abundant
bearer is unrivalled by any other variety. It succeeds well in almost
every description of soil and situation where it is possible for apples to
grow.</p>

<p>This variety was raised at Hawthornden, a romantic spot near Edinburgh,
celebrated as the birthplace and residence of Drummond the
poet, who was born there in 1585. I have never learnt at what period
the Hawthornden was first discovered. The first mention of it is in the
catalogue of Leslie and Anderson, of Edinburgh; but I do not think
it was known about London till 1790, when it was introduced to the
Brompton Park nursery.</p>

roundish and flattened, with ribs on the sides. Skin, greenish-yellow,

<p>The tree is a strong grower, vigorous, healthy, and a good bearer.</p>

<p>This is the Holland Pippin of Langley and Miller, but not of Ray or
Ralph Austen, who make it synonymous with the Kirton Pippin, which
Ray describes as being small and oblate, and the same as is called Broad-eye
in Sussex. The Holland Pippin is a native of the Holland district
of Lincolnshire, hence its name.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and three inches
high; conical, irregular
in its outline, ribbed,
and distinctly
four-sided; at about
four-fifths of its length
towards the crown it
is very much contracted
and swells
out again towards
the eye, altogether
very much resembling
a codlin in
shape. Skin, smooth
and shining, pale
grass green on the
shaded side, and
covered with a cloud
of pale red next the
sun, thinly strewed
with dots, which are
red on the exposed,
and dark green on
the shaded side. Eye,
small and closed, set
in a narrow, contracted, and plaited basin, which is surrounded with
several small knobs. Stalk, green and downy, half-an-inch long, inserted
in a narrow, close, and deep basin, which is quite smooth. Flesh, white,
very tender and delicate, with a brisk, mild, and pleasant flavor. Core,
very large, with open cells.</p>

<p>An excellent culinary apple, with a fine perfume; ripe in September.</p>

<p>This variety is extensively grown in Berkshire, particularly about Newbury
and Reading, whence large quantities are sent to London for the
supply of Covent Garden Market.</p>

<p>Hubbard’s Pearmain was first introduced to public notice by Mr. George
Lindley, at a meeting of the London Horticultural Society in 1820.
“This,” says Mr. Lindley, “is a real Norfolk apple, well known in the
Norwich market; and although it may be found elsewhere, its great excellence
may have caused its removal hence. The merits of Hubbard’s
Pearmain as a table apple are unrivalled, and its superior, from the commencement
of its season to the end, does not, I am of opinion, exist in
this country.”</p>

extending beyond the base. Flesh, yellowish-white tinged with green,
firm and leathery, juicy and sugary, with a rich and highly aromatic
flavor, very similar to, and little inferior to the Ribston Pippin.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of the first quality, whether as regards its long duration,
or the peculiar richness of its flavor: it is in use from December
to March; but according to Mr. Thompson&mdash;no mean authority&mdash;it will
keep for two years. It may, however, be a question whether or not this
is identical with the Hunt’s Deux Ans of the Horticultural Society, which
Mr. Thompson regards as only a second-rate fruit. If it is the same, the
climate of Somersetshire, whence I had both trees and specimens of the
fruit, is more adapted for bringing it to perfection than that of Chiswick.</p>

name it now bears, from being sent to the Horticultural Society of London,
by Thomas Hunt <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Stratford-on-Avon, in 1820. Mr. Lindley
gives Hunt’s Nonpariel as a synonyme of Duke of Gloucester; but it is

broken streaks of the same color; but where shaded it is veined with
thin brown russet, particularly about the eye, and very thinly strewed
with russety dots. Eye, large, half open, with broad flat segments, set
in a narrow, and deeply furrowed basin. Stalk, an inch long, straight, inserted
in a very shallow cavity, sometimes between two fleshy lips, but
generally with a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, greenish-white,
firm, tender, and with a brisk, but rather coarse and rough acid
flavor.</p>

<p>A useful culinary apple; in use from December to March.</p>

<p>Its chief recommendation is, the immense productiveness of the tree,
which is rather small, with pendulous shoots, and extremely hardy;
it succeeds in exposed situations where many other varieties could not
grow. Rogers says, “it is a tree of the third class in the orchard, and
will answer well in exposed situations, trained as dwarfs or half-standards,
it being equal in hardihood, and very fit to be planted along with the
Grey Leadington.”</p>

<p>Fruit, small; round, and a little flattened. Skin, smooth and shining,
pale yellowish-green in the shade;
but clear yellow, with sometimes
a faint tinge of red or orange
next the sun. Eye, small and
closed, surrounded with a few
small plaits, and set in a very shallow
basin. Stalk, an inch long,
slender, and inserted in a shallow
cavity, which is lined with delicate
russet. Flesh, white, crisp,
brisk, and juicy, with a vinous and
slightly perfumed flavor, but becoming
meally and tasteless, if
kept only a few days after being
gathered.</p>

<p>This is the earliest apple of the year, the first of Pomona’s autumnal
offerings; it is in greatest perfection when gathered off the tree, or immediately
afterwards, as it very soon becomes dry and meally.</p>

<p>The tree does not attain a large size, but is hardy and healthy. It is
not a great bearer, which may, in a great measure, account for it not
being so generally cultivated, as its earliness would recommend it to be.
If worked on the paradise stock it may be grown in pots, when the fruit
will not only be produced earlier, but in greater abundance than on the
crab, or free stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>This is one of our oldest apples, and although generally known and
popular, seems to have escaped the notice of Miller, who does not even
mention <span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘it any’.">it in any</span> of the editions of his dictionary. As I have doubts of
this being the Geneting of Parkinson&mdash;his figure being evidently intended
for the Margaret, which in some districts is called Joanneting&mdash;the
first mention we have of this variety is by Rea, in 1665, who
describes it as “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a small, yellow, red-sided apple, upon a wall, ripe in
the end of June</span>.”</p>

<p>The orthography which I have adopted in the nomenclature of this
apple may, to some, at first sight, seem strange; but I am nevertheless
persuaded it is the correct one. The different forms in which it has
been written will be found in the synonymes given above, none of which
afford any assistance as to the derivation or signification of the name.
Abercrombie was the first who wrote it June-eating, as if in allusion to
the period of its maturity, which is, however, not till the end of July.
Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, writes it Gineting, and says it is a corruption
of Janeton (<i><abbr title="French">Fr.</abbr></i>) signifying Jane or Janet, having been so called
from a person of that name. Ray<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pomum Ginettinum, quod
unde dictum sit me latet.</span>” Indeed there does not seem ever to have
been a correct definition given of it.</p>

<p>In the middle ages, it was customary to make the festivals of the
church, or saint’s days, periods on which occurrences were to take place,
or from which events were dated. Even in the present day, we hear the
country people talking of some crop to be sown, or some other to be
planted at Michaelmas, St. Martin’s, or Saint Andrew’s-tide. It was
also the practice, during the reign of Popery in this country, as is still
the case in all Roman Catholic countries, for parents to dedicate their
children to some particular saint, as Jean Baptiste, on the recurrence of
whose festival, all who are so named keep it as a holiday. So it was also
in regard to fruits, which were named after the day about which they
came to maturity. Thus, we have the Margaret Apple, so called from being
ripe about St. Margaret’s day&mdash;the 20th of July. The Magdalene, or
Maudlin, from St. Magdalene’s day&mdash;the 22nd of July. And in Curtius<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
we find the <i>Joannina</i>, so called, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod circa divi Joannis Baptistæ nativitatem
esui sint.</span>” These are also noticed by J. B. Porta; he says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est
genus alterum quod quia circa festum Divi Joannis maturiscit, vulgus
<i>Melo de San Giovanni</i> dicitur.</span>” And according to Tragus,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæ apud
nos prima maturantur, Sanct Johans Öpffel, Latine, Præcocia mala
dicuntur.</span>”</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that they were called Joannina, because they ripened
about St. John’s Day. We have also among the old French pears Amiré
Joannet&mdash;the Admired, or Wonderful Little John, which Merlet informs
us was so called, because it ripened about St. John’s Day. If then we
add to Joannet the termination <i>ing</i>, so general among our names of
apples, we have <i>Joanneting</i>. There can be no doubt that this is the correct
derivation, and signification of the name of this apple, and although
the orthography may for a time appear singular, it will in the course of
usage become as familiar as the other forms in which <span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘it as been’.">it has been</span> written.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and five eighths wide, and two inches

yellowish-brown russet, like the Golden Russet, and occasionally with a
bright, varnished, fiery-red cheek on the side next the sun, which is
sometimes more distinct than at others. Eye, open, set in a round and
plaited basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a rather shallow cavity.
Flesh, yellow, firm, juicy, and sugary, with a particularly rich, mellow
flavor, equal to, and even surpassing that of the Ribston Pippin.</p>

<p>A delicious dessert apple, of first-rate quality: in use from October to
January, and, under favorable circumstances, will even keep till March.</p>

<p>This is an apple which is very little known, and does not seem at all
to be in general cultivation. I obtained it from the private garden of the
late Mr. James Lee, at Hammersmith. It certainly deserves greater

<p>This is a very old and favorite apple, first mentioned by Ray, and

<p>Fruit, below medium size; oval, sometimes roundish-oval. Skin,
smooth and shining, greenish-yellow

as it ripens to a fine clear pale
yellow color, tinged and streaked
with red, on the side next

small and closed, with broad,
erect, and acuminate segments,
set in a shallow basin,
which is generally surrounded
with five prominent plaits.
Stalk, slender, three quarters
of an inch long, obliquely inserted in a small cavity, by the side of a fleshy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>

a rich, sugary, brisk, and aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>An early dessert apple of the highest excellence; It is in use during

<p>The tree is a free grower, hardy, and a good bearer, attaining about
the middle size. It is well adapted for grafting on the paradise stock,

<p>Fruit, large; conical and angular. Skin, pale yellow, with a blush on

Stalk, short, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, pale yellow, very juicy,

<p>One of the earliest, and most valuable of our culinary apples. It may
be used for tarts so early as the end of June; but its greatest perfection
is during August and September.</p>

<p>The tree is healthy, vigorous, and an immense bearer, attaining to the
middle size. It succeeds well in almost every soil and situation, and
when grown on the paradise stock, is well suited for espalier training.</p>

<p>This excellent apple was first discovered, growing among a quantity of
rubbish, behind a wall at Gleaston Castle, near Ulverstone, and was
first brought into notice by one John Sander, a nurseryman at Keswick,
who having propagated it, sent it out under the name of Keswick Codlin.</p>

<p>In the Memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural Society, Sir John
Sinclair says, “the Keswick Codlin tree has never failed to bear a crop
since it was planted in the Episcopal garden at Rose Castle, Carlisle,
twenty years ago (1813). It is an apple of fine tartness and flavor,
and may be used early in autumn. The tree is a very copious
bearer, and the fruit is of good size, considerably larger than the
Carlisle Codlin. It flourishes best in a strong soil.”</p>

<p>Fruit, small; roundish or oblato-oblong, regularly and handsomely
shaped. Skin, smooth
greenish-yellow on the
shaded side, but becoming
clear yellow when at maturity;
on the side next the
sun it is dull orange, streaked
and striped with red,
which becomes more faint
as it extends to the shaded
side, and dotted all over
with minute, punctured,
russety dots. Eye, rather
large, and open, with long,
broad segments, reflexed at
the tips, and set in a wide,
deep and plaited basin.
Stalk, from a quarter to
half-an-inch long, slender, deeply inserted in a russety cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white, firm, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a brisk, and
rich vinous flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of first-rate quality, and very valuable, both as regards
the richness of its flavor, and the long period to which it remains in perfection;
it is in use from January, and keeps till April without shrivelling.</p>

<p>The tree is healthy, a free grower, and good bearer.</p>

<p>This variety was raised in the year 1804, by the wife of Neil Malcolm
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Lamb Abbey, near Dartford in Kent, from the pip of an imported
fruit of the Newtown Pippin.</p>

</div>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; oval, with a large fleshy elongation covering the
stalk, which gives it the form of a lemon. Skin, pale yellow tinged with
green, changing to a lemon yellow as it attains maturity, strewed with
russety freckles, and patches of thin delicate russet. Eye, small, and
partially open, with short segments, and set in an irregular basin, which
is frequently higher on one side than the other. Stalk, short, entirely
covered with a fleshy elongation of the fruit. Flesh, firm, crisp, and
briskly flavored.</p>

<p>A very good apple, either for culinary or dessert use; it is in season
from October to April, and is perhaps the most characteristic apple we
have, being sometimes so much like a lemon, as at first sight to be taken
for that fruit. Forsyth says it is excellent for drying.</p>

<p>The tree does not attain a large size; but is healthy, hardy, and a
good bearer.</p>

<p>It is uncertain at what period the Lemon Pippin was first brought into
notice. Rogers calls it the “Quince Apple,” and, if it is what has always
been known under that name, it must be of considerable antiquity, being
mentioned by Rea, Worlidge, Ray, and almost all the early writers; but
the first instance wherein we find it called Lemon Pippin, is in Ellis’s
“Modern Husbandman” 1744, where he says it is “esteemed so good
an apple for all uses, that many plant this tree preferable to all others.”</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, and flattened, with a few ribs on
the sides which increase in size towards the crown where they terminate
in five prominent and equal ridges, from which circumstance it has been
called the Five-Crowned Pippin. Skin, at first pale yellowish-green,
changing to pale yellow or lemon color, with brownish-red on the side
next the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a rather shallow basin.
Stalk, half an inch long, slender, and deeply inserted. Flesh, yellowish-white,
firm, crisp, tender, and juicy, with a brisk and pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>An excellent culinary apple, and serviceable also for the dessert; it
is in use from November to April, when it is perfectly sound and shows
no symptoms of shrivelling.</p>

<p>The tree attains about the middle size, is not a strong grower, but
quite hardy, and an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>Although there is no record of this variety in the writings of any
pomological author before Mr. Lindley, it is nevertheless a very old
English apple. In an ancient note-book of an ancestor of Sir John
Trevelyan, Bart., of Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, so early as 1580, the
“Lounden Peppen” is mentioned among the “names of Apelles which I
had their graffes from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace.” From this we
may learn, that we are not to take for granted the non-existence of any
variety, simply because there is no notice of it, previous to the period
when it may have been first recorded, in works on pomology.</p>

closed, set in a shallow basin. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long, fleshy
at the insertion, sometimes with a fleshy protuberance on one side of it,
and inserted in a narrow, shallow, and russety cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white,
crisp, and tender, with a slightly sweet but rather indifferent
flavor.</p>

<p>An apple of little merit, being of no value either for culinary purposes
or the dessert; it is in season from October to December, and is met
with in the Berkshire Orchards.</p>

<p>Fruit, rather below medium size; roundish. Skin, yellowish-white,
with numerous imbedded pearly specks, with an orange tinge next the
sun, and sometimes marked with faint streaks of red. Eye, small and
closed, set in a narrow basin, and surrounded with several unequal plaits.
Stalk, short and slender, not extending beyond the base, and inserted in
a funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white, very crisp and tender, juicy, sugary,
and highly flavored.</p>

<p>An early dessert apple, of good, but only second-rate quality; ripe in
the middle and end of August.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, and is readily distinguished by the excessive
pubescence of its leaves and shoots.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindley in the “Guide to the Orchard” considers this variety as
identical with the Margaret of Ray, which is a mistake. It is no doubt
the Margaret of Miller, but certainly not of any English author either
preceeding, or subsequent to him. It is to be observed that the lists of
fruits given by Miller in his Dictionary are chiefly taken from the works
of the French pomologists, while the fruits of his own country are almost
wholly neglected; and the only reason I can assign for him describing
this variety for the Margaret is, because our own Margaret being by some
authors called the <i>Magdalene</i>, he might have thought the two synonymous.&mdash;See

<p>This variety is of American origin. It is highly esteemed in the
neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and considered one of the best culinary

is considered the best. It is not however held in great repute in this
country, its size and color being its chief recommendation.</p>

<p>Fruit, large; conical, and slightly angular. Skin, smooth, greenish-yellow
at first, but changing as it ripens to clear pale-yellow, tinged with
rich orange-red on the side next the sun; but sometimes, when fully exposed,
assuming a clear bright-red cheek. Eye, small and closed, set in
a small, plaited, and pretty deep basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch
long, more or less fleshy, sometimes straight, but generally obliquely inserted,
and occasionally united to the fruit by a fleshy protuberance on
one side of it. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, brisk, juicy and slightly
perfumed.</p>

<p>A very valuable early culinary apple, of first-rate quality. It is ripe in
the beginning of August, and continues in use till November.</p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, and healthy, but not a large grower. It is a
very early and abundant bearer, young trees in the nursery quarters
generally producing a considerable quantity of fruit, when only two years
old from the grafts. It is well suited for planting in exposed situations,
and succeeds well in shallow soils. It forms a beautiful little tree when
grafted on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for espalier training.</p>

</div>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; abrupt pearmain-shaped. Skin, of a rich golden-yellow
color, covered with thin brown russet, on the shaded side; but
covered with dull brownish-red, on the side next the sun. Eye, partially
closed, with broad flat segments, set in a shallow and plaited basin.
Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, obliquely inserted in a moderately
deep cavity, with generally a fleshy protuberance on one side of it.
Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, and very sugary; with a brisk and particularly
rich flavor.</p>

<p>This is one of the best and richest flavored of our dessert apples. It
is only of recent introduction; but will no doubt, ere long, prove one of the
most popular, as it is one of the most valuable varieties in its class; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
only on account of its excellence, but for the long period during which
it is in perfection; it comes into use in October and November, and
continues in good condition till March.</p>

<p>A communication of
some importance has
been forwarded to me
by Mr. Cameron of
Uckfield, by whom this
variety was first propagated.
He says the
fruit should be allowed
to hang late on the tree
before it is gathered, so
as to secure its peculiar
richness of flavor, and
long period of duration;
for if gathered too soon,
it looses much of its fine
richness and is very
apt to shrivel.</p>

<p>The tree does not
attain a large size, but
is perfectly hardy, and
an early and excellent
bearer; young trees, only two or three years from the graft, producing a
considerable crop of handsome, well-grown fruit.</p>

<p>This esteemed variety originated about the year 1770, in a garden
now in the possession of Mr. Mannington, a respectable butcher at Uckfield
in Sussex. At the time it was raised the garden belonged to Mr.
Turley, a blacksmith, and grandfather of Mr. Mannington. The original
tree grew up at the root of a hedge, where the refuse from a cider press
had been thrown; it never attained any great size, but continued to
preserve a stunted, and diminutive habit of growth, till it died about the
year 1820. Previous to this, however, grafts had been freely distributed
to persons in the neighbourhood, many of whom were anxious to possess
such a desideratum; but it does not seem to have been known beyond its
own locality, till the autumn of 1847, when Mr. Mannington caused
specimens of the fruit to be forwarded to the London Horticultural Society,
and by whom it was pronounced to be a dessert fruit of the highest excellence.
It was designated by Mr. Thompson “Mannington’s Pearmain.”</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish-ovate, and narrowing towards the eye,
where it is angular. Skin, greenish-yellow
on the shaded side;
but bright-red next the sun, striped
all over with darker red, and
strewed with grey russety dots.
Eye, half open, and prominent;
with long, broad, erect segments,
surrounded with a number of
puckered knobs. Stalk, short and
thick, about half-an-inch long,
inserted in a small, and shallow
cavity. Flesh, greenish-white,
brisk, juicy, and vinous, with a
pleasant and very refreshing flavor.</p>

<p>A first-rate early dessert apple;
it is ripe in the beginning of
August, but does not keep long, being
very liable to become meally.
To have it in perfection, it is well
to gather it a few days before it ripens on the tree, and thereby secure
its juicy, and vinous flavor.</p>

<p>The tree does not attain a large size, being rather a small grower. It
is a good bearer, more so than the Joanneting, and is quite hardy, except
in light soils, when it is liable to canker. It is well adapted for growing
as dwarfs, either for potting or being trained as an espalier, when grafted
on the paradise, or pomme paradis stock.</p>

<p>This is a very old English apple. It is without doubt the Margaret
of Rea, Worldige, Ray, and all our early pomologists except Miller; Mr.
Lindley, however, is of a different opinion, for he believes the Margaret
of Miller to be identical with that of Ray. That this variety is the
Margaret of Rea, his description is sufficient evidence. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The <i>Margaret
or Magdelen Apple</i> is a fair and beautiful fruit, yellow, and thick striped
with red, early ripe, of a delicate taste, sweet flavor, and best eaten off
the tree.</span>” Ray gives <i>no description</i> of it, but it is only reasonable to
suppose, that it is this variety he refers to, seeing it is the Margaret of
all authors both immediately preceeding, and subsequent to him. And
indeed in no instance is that of Miller noticed by any English author,
but himself, anterior to Mr. Lindley.</p>

conical, distinctly five sided, with acute angles on the side, which termin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ate
at the crown in five prominent ridges. Skin, orange, streaked with
deep red, and covered on one side with patches of russet. Eye, small and
closed, compressed as it were between the angles of the basin. Stalk,
half-an-inch long, slender, and rather deeply inserted in a round, and
russety cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, juicy, rich, and sugary, with a powerful,
and delicious aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>One of the finest dessert apples, a rival of the Ribston Pippin, excelling
it in juiciness, and being of a better size for the dessert; it is in use from
November to February.</p>

<p>The tree is quite hardy, and generally an abundant bearer, except in
seasons when the bloom is injured by frosts, to which it is liable. It is of a
small, and slender habit of growth, and is well adapted for growing as
dwarfs, or espaliers, when grafted on the paradise stock.</p>

<p>There seems to be no record of this variety before the publication of
the <i>Pomona Londonensis</i>, although it was known for many years previously.
Rogers says, he saw a tree of it growing as an espalier in the garden
at Sheen, which was planted by Sir William Temple. I find it was
cultivated to a considerable extent in the Brompton Park nursery, so
early as 1750; it must therefore have been well known at that period;
but I cannot discover any trace of its origin. It may have been introduced
from the continent by George London who was for some years
in the gardens at Versailles under De Quintinye, and afterwards in partnership
with Henry Wise as proprietor of the Brompton Park nursery,
as the name seems to indicate more of French than English origin.</p>

side; but covered with fine dark crimson, on the side next the sun. Eye,
small and closed, with long acuminate segments, and set in a pretty wide,

of an inch long, inserted in a small, and smooth cavity. Flesh, white
with a greenish tinge, very delicate, juicy, and tender, with a sweet and
vinous flavor, and a perfume like that of roses.</p>

<p>A dessert apple, which, when in perfection, is of the most exquisite
flavor, but being indigenous to a warmer climate, it does not attain its
full maturity in this country. By the aid of a south wall, in a warm
and sheltered situation, it may however be brought to some degree of
perfection. At Elvaston Castle, Mr. Barron has successfully cultivated
it upon earthen mounds, with an inclination to the sun, of 45°. When
in perfection, its flesh is said to be as melting as that of the Beurré,
and Doyenné pears; it is in use from December to March.</p>

which extend from about the middle, to the basin of the eye, where
they form large and unequal ridges; and also by several flattened parts
on the sides, giving it the appearance as if indented by a blow. Skin,
smooth and shining, pale yellow tinged with green, on the shaded side;
but yellow tinged with orange, and marked with crimson spots and dots,
on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, large and closed, with broad flat
segments, and deeply set in a plaited, and prominently ribbed basin.
Stalk, very short, not more than a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a
deep, irregular cavity, in which are a few streaks and patches of rough
russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, but tender and marrow-like, with
a sweet, and pleasantly sub-acid flavor.</p>

<p>A very valuable and fine looking apple, of first-rate quality, suitable
either for culinary purposes or the dessert; it is in use from October to
January.</p>

<p>The tree is a strong, healthy, and vigorous grower, and forms a large
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘round head,&nbsp;&nbsp;’.">round head.</span> It is also an abundant and free bearer.</p>

<p>This is an old Scotch apple, the cultivation of which is confined exclusively
to the Border counties, where it was probably first introduced
by the monks of Melrose Abbey. Though it is one of the most popular
apples of the Tweedside orchards, it does not seem to have been ever known
beyond its own district. It is without doubt the largest, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
most useful apples of which Scotland can boast, and requires only to be
more generally known, to be cultivated throughout the length and breadth
of that country. Even in the south it is not to be disregarded, as both
in size, and quality, it is one of the most attractive market apples. I
have known them sold at two shillings a dozen. The figure given above
is only from a medium-sized specimen of the fruit.</p>

<p>This variety was discovered many years ago, in the West Riding of

into notice by John Nelson, a noted Wesleyan preacher in that part of
the country, who, during his professional visits distributed grafts of it
among his friends. From this circumstance it became generally known
by the name of the Nelson Apple. It was called Backhouse’s Lord Nelson
by Mr. Ronalds in the Pyrus Malus Brentfordiensis, from having been received
from the York nursery; but Mr. Backhouse, to whom it refers, disclaims
having any merit either in the origin or introduction of it, and
prefers retaining simply the name of “Nelson”, as a tribute to the
memory of the excellent man after whom it was named.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish, broadest at the base, with broad obscure
ribs extending to the apex, which give it an irregularity in its outline.
Skin, at first dull green, but changing as it ripens to a fine olive-green,
or greenish-yellow, with a redish-brown tinge next the sun, and
dotted all over with small grey russety dots. Eye, small and closed, set
in a small and rather shallow basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender,
and inserted all its length, in a deep, round cavity lined with delicate
russet, which extends over a portion of the base. Flesh, yellowish-white
tinged with green, firm, crisp, very juicy, with a rich, and highly aromatic
flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple, which, when in perfection, is not to be surpassed. It
is in use from December to April. This description being taken from an
imported specimen, it must not be expected that fruit grown in this
country, will attain the same degree of perfection; for like most of the
best American apples, it does not succeed in this climate. Even with the
protection of a wall, and in the most favorable situation, it does not
possess that peculiarly rich aroma, which characterizes the imported fruit.</p>

<p>The tree is a slender, and slow grower, and is always distinguished,
even in its young state, by the roughness of its bark. It prefers a strong,
rich, and genial soil, and, according to Coxe, does not arrive at maturity
till 20 or 25 years old.</p>

<p>This is an old American apple. It originated at Newtown, on Long
Island, U. S., and was introduced to this country about the middle of
the last century. I find it was cultivated in the Brompton Park nursery
so early as 1768, under the name of “Newtown Pippin from New York.”
Forsyth remarks that it is said to have been originally from Devonshire,
but if it were so, there would still have been some trace of it left in that
county. It is extensively cultivated in New York, and all the middle
states, and particularly on the Hudson, where the finest American orchards
are. There are immense quantities produced which are packed in
barrels and exported to Britain and other parts. The month of January,
is generally the season they arrive in this country, and then they are the
most attractive of all dessert apples in Covent Garden market; the name
serving in many instances, as a decoy for the sale of many other and inferior
varieties. The Alfriston, in many collections, is erroneously cultivated
under the name of Newtown Pippin.</p>

<p>Fruit, above medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and two
inches and a quarter deep; roundish, regularly and handsomely formed,
a little flattened, somewhat resembling a Nonesuch. Skin, smooth, at
first pale-yellow tinged with green, but changing to a beautiful clear yellow,
on the shaded side; but of a beautiful clear red streaked with
deeper red, on the side next the sun, and strewed with numerous small,
russety dots. Eye, open, set in a wide, and even basin. Stalk, short
and stout, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, rich and
pleasantly flavored.</p>

<p>An American dessert apple, very pretty, and handsome; of good quality,
but only second-rate; it is in use from November to February.</p>

<p>This variety originated at Newtown on Long Island U. S. It received
the name of Matchless, from the late William Cobbett, who sold it under
that <span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘name’ at end of line.">name.</span></p>

</ul>

<p>Fruit, rather large, of an oblong figure, somewhat pyramidal, rather
irregular in its outline, and slightly pentangular on its sides, three of
which are generally much shorter than the other, forming a kind of lip
at the crown; from two inches and a half to three inches deep, and the
same in diameter at the base. Eye, closed, rather deeply sunk in a very
uneven irregular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, rather deeply
inserted in a wide uneven cavity. Skin, dull greenish-yellow, with a few
green specks, intermixed with a little skin, (thin?) grey russet, and tinged
with brown on the sunny side. Flesh, firm, crisp, tender. Juice,
plentiful, saccharine, with a slight aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple; in use from November to April.</p>

<p>An American variety of excellence. The tree grows large, and bears
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber’s Note:  Originally ‘well&nbsp;&nbsp;’.">well.</span> It sometimes happens with this as it does with Hubbard’s Pearmain,
that smooth fruit grow upon one branch and russety ones upon another;
and in cold seasons the fruit are for the most part russety.</p>

<p>It was named the New York Pippin by Mr. Mackie, and first propagated
in his nursery, at Norwich, about forty years ago. (1831.)</p>

<p>Never having seen or met with this apple, I have here given Mr.
Lindley’s descriptions verbatim, for the benefit of those who may meet
with it; as it is no doubt still in existence in the county of Norfolk.</p>

a quarter high; roundish-oblate, regularly and handsomely shaped.
Skin, smooth, pale yellow, mottled with thin pale red, on the shaded side;
and striped with broad, broken stripes of red next the sun. Eye, small
and closed, set in a wide, shallow, and even basin. Stalk, short and
slender, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, sugary
and slightly perfumed.</p>

<p>An excellent culinary apple, of first-rate quality, and, according to Mr.
Thompson, excellent for apple jelly; it is ripe in September, and continues
during October.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, attaining about the middle size, and is an
abundant, and early bearer, young trees three years old from the graft
producing an abundance of beautiful fruit.</p>

<p>Although an old variety, I do not think this is the Nonesuch, of Rea,
Worlidge, or Ray, as all these authors mention it as being a long keeper,
for which circumstance, it might otherwise have been considered the
same. Rea says “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">it is a middle sized, round, and red striped apple, of
a delicate taste, and long lasting</span>.” Worlidge’s variety is probably the
same as Rea’s he says “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The Non-such is a long lasting fruit, good at the
table, and well marked for cider.</span>” And Ray also includes his Non-such
among the Winter Apples.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish, broad at the base and narrowing towards
the apex. Skin, yellowish-green, covered with large patches of
thin grey russet, and dotted with small brown russety dots, with occasionally
a tinge of dull red, on the side next the sun. Eye, rather prominent,
very slightly if at all depressed, half open, with broad segments which
are reflexed at the tips. Stalk, an inch long, set in a round and pretty
deep cavity which is lined with russet. Flesh, greenish, delicate, crisp,
rich, and juicy, abounding in a particularly rich, vinous, and aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>One of the most highly esteemed and popular of all our dessert apples.
It is in use from January till May.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, and healthy, scarcely attaining the middle
size, and an excellent bearer. It prefers a light and warm soil, succeeds
well on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for growing in pots, when
grafted on the pomme paradis of the French. Bradley in one of his tracts
records an instance of it being so cultivated. “Mr. Fairchild (of Hoxton)
has now (February) one of the Nonpareile apples upon a small tree, in a
pot, which seems capable of holding good till the blossoms of this year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
have ripened their fruit.” In the northern counties and in Scotland, it
does not succeed as a standard as it does in the south, and even when
grown against a wall, there is a marked contrast in the flavor when compared
with the standard grown fruit of the south.</p>

<p>It is generally allowed that the Nonpareil is originally from France.
Switzer says “It is no stranger in England; though it might have its
original from France, yet there are trees of them about the Ashtons in
Oxfordshire, of about a hundred years old, which (as they have it by tradition)
was first brought out of France and planted by a Jesuit in Queen
Mary or Queen Elizabeth’s time.” It is strange, however, that an apple
of such excellence, and held in such estimation as the Nonpareil has always
been, should have received so little notice from almost all the early continental
pomologists.
It is not mentioned in
the long list of the
Jardinier François of
1653, nor even by De
Quintinye, or the Jardinier
Solitaire. Schabol
enumerates it, but
it is not noticed by
Bretonnerie. It is
first described by Duhamel
and subsequently
by Knoop.
In the Chartreux catalogue
it is said “elle
est forte estimée en
Angleterre”, but,
among the writers of
our own country, Switzer
is the first to notice
it. It is not mentioned by Rea, Worlidge or Ray, neither is it enumerated
in the list of Leonard Meager. In America it is little esteemed.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two inches and three

angles or ribs, which extend from the base to the basin of the eye, where
they form prominent knobs or ridges. Skin, smooth, green at first, but
changing to yellow, and almost entirely covered with dull brownish-red,
which is thickest and darkest next the sun; sometimes it is marked with
a few broken stripes of dark crimson, and in specimens where the color
extends over the whole surface, the shaded side is mottled with yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
spots. Eye, open, set in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk short,
inserted in a deep and russety cavity. Flesh, firm and crisp, with a brisk
and pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>A well known and first-rate culinary apple; it is in use from January
to June. It is extensively cultivated in Norfolk, where, besides being
applied to general culinary purposes, they are baked in ovens, and form
the dried fruits met with among confectioners and fruiterers, called
“Norfolk Biffins.”</p>

<p>The tree is vigorous in its young state, but unless grown in a rich soil,
and a favorable situation, it is apt to canker, particularly if it is too moist.</p>

<p>The name of this apple has hitherto been written Beaufin, as if of French
origin; but it is more correctly Beefing, from the similarity the dried
fruit presents to raw beef.</p>

<p>An excellent apple,
of first-rate
quality, and well
deserving of more
general cultivation; It is in use
from January to
May, and keeps well.</p>

<p>Some thirty years ago, Ord’s apple was brought into public notice as
a variety which was worthy of universal cultivation; and was considered
of such importance as to form the subject of a paper in the Horticultural
Society’s Transactions, by A. Salisbury <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> At that time it was received
into all the collections in the London nurseries, and was very generally
grown; but in the course of years it was again lost sight of, and I
believe there are now very few places where it is to be met with. I shall
be glad, however, if this notice should direct the attention of some lover
of a good apple, to rescue this excellent variety from the oblivion into
which it is likely to fall, and to restore it to the position it once occupied
as one of our finest dessert apples.</p>

<p>This excellent variety originated at Purser’s Cross, near Fulham,
Middlesex. It was raised in the garden of John Ord, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by his sister-in-law,
Mrs. Anne Simpson, from seed of a Newtown Pippin imported
in 1777. There is another variety called <i>Simpson’s Seedling</i>, raised from
the seed of Ord’s apple, to which it is very similar; but being much inferior
in quality, its cultivation has been in a great measure discontinued.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches high;
roundish-oblate, evenly and regularly formed. Skin, thick and membranous,
of a fine pale yellow color, and thickly strewed with brown dots; very
frequently cracked, forming large and deep sinuosities on the fruit. Eye,
scarcely at all depressed. Stalk, short and thick, inserted in a very
shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp and juicy, rich and sugary,
with a highly aromatic flavor, which is peculiar to this apple only.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of the highest excellence; ripe in the end of August, and
continues during September, but does not last long. Nicol says “this
is an excellent apple, as to flavor it is outdone by none but the Nonpareil,
over which it has this advantage, that it will ripen in a worse climate and
a worse aspect.”</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, of an upright habit, and an excellent bearer;
but is subject to canker as it grows old. The branches are generally
covered with a number of knobs or burrs; and when planted in the ground
these burrs throw out numerous fibres which take root and produce a perfect
tree.</p>

<p>This is a very old Scotch apple, supposed to have originated at Arbroath;
or to have been introduced from France by the monks of the
Abbey which formerly existed at that place. The latter opinion is, in all
probability, the correct one, although the name, or any of the synonymes
quoted above are not now to be met with in any modern French lists.
But in the “Jardinier François” which was published in 1651, I find
an apple mentioned under the name of Orgeran, which is so similar in
pronounciation to Orgeline, I think it not unlikely it may be the same
name with a change of orthography, especially as our ancestors were
not over particular, in preserving unaltered the names of foreign introductions.</p>

<p>Fruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; orbicular, flattened at the base and apex.
Skin, yellowish-green, strewed with thin russet and russety dots on the
shaded side; but washed with thin red, and strewed with russety specks
on the side next the sun. Eye, large and open, with short stunted segments,
set in a wide and shallow basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, inserted
in a wide, and rather shallow cavity, which is lined with thin russet.
Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, rich, juicy and sugary, with a brisk
and aromatic flavor, somewhat resembling, and little inferior to the Ribston
Pippin.</p>

<p>A handsome and very excellent dessert apple; it is in use from October
to February, and is not subject to be attacked with the grub, as the
Ribston Pippin is.</p>

<p>This variety was raised from the seed of the Ribston Pippin, at Osterley
Park, the seat of the Earl of Jersey, near Isleworth, Middlesex, where
the original tree is still in existence.</p>

<p>Fruit, small and conical. Skin, entirely grass green, always covered
with a thin russet; sometimes when highly ripened it is tinged with a
very pale brown on the sunny side. Eye, very small, surrounded with
a few obscure plaits. Stalk, very slender, three quarters of an inch long.
Flesh, pale green, very firm and crisp, not juicy, but very rich and
highly flavored.</p>

<p>A dessert apple; in use from November to April.</p>

<p>I have never seen this apple. It was first noticed by Mr. George
Lindley whose description of it I have given above. He says “it is supposed
to have originated at Oxnead, near Norwich, the seat of the Earl
of Yarmouth. It has been known many years in Norfolk, no doubt prior
to the extinction of that Peerage in 1733, and I have never seen it out
of the county. The tree is a very small grower; its branches are small
and wiry and of a grass green color; it is very hardy and an excellent
bearer.”</p>

<p>Fruit, small, two inches wide, and an inch and a half high; roundish-oblate.
Skin, pale greenish-yellow rather thickly covered with thin grey
russet, and faintly tinged with orange next the sun. Eye, small and
closed, set in a shallow and rather angular basin. Stalk, three quarters
of an inch long, slender, and inserted in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh,
yellow, juicy, sugary, brisk and richly aromatic.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use during December and
January.</p>

<p>The tree is of small dimensions, but healthy, and a prolific bearer. It
is well adapted for dwarf training, when grown on the paradise or doucin
stock.</p>

<p>This variety was raised by Mr. Padley, gardener to his Majesty George
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, at Hampton Court. According to Rogers, Mr. Padley was a native
of Yorkshire, and after coming to London and filling a situation of respectability,
he was appointed foreman in the kitchen garden at Kew.
“On the death of the celebrated ‘Capability Brown’ Mr. G. Haverfield
was removed from Kew to Hampton Court, and took Mr. Padley with him
as foreman. On the death of Haverfield, Padley’s interest with his sovereign
out-weighed all the interests of other candidates, though urged by
the most influential persons about Court. ‘No, no, no,’ said his Majesty,
‘it is Padley’s birthright.’”</p>

<p>Fruit, small; roundish-oblate, even and regularly formed. Skin, thick,
red all over, pale on the shaded side, but of a deep and bright color next
the sun; and so sensitive of shade, if any portion of it is covered with a
leaf or twig, a corresponding yellow mark will be found on the fruit.
Eye, small, set in a narrow, even, and rather deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch
long, slender, set in a wide, deep, and even cavity. Flesh, white,
tinged with red under the skin on the side exposed to the sun, crisp,
juicy, and richly flavored when first gathered, but soon becomes dry and
woolly.</p>

<p>An excellent early apple, suitable either for culinary purposes or dessert
use; it is ripe in the beginning of August, but may be used in pies before
then. Bretonnerie says it may be used “en compôte” in the beginning
of July, and is preferable to the Calville Rouge d’Eté.</p>

</ul>

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches and
three quarters high; conical and angular. Skin, membranous, shining,
pale yellow with a greenish tinge, which it loses as it attains maturity;
but covered with fine clear red on the side next the sun, and strewed all
over with minute russety dots and imbedded white specks; the whole
surface is covered with a bluish bloom, from which circumstance it receives
the name of Pigeon, being considered similar to the plumage of a dove.
Eye, open, with erect segments, prominently set in a narrow and plaited
basin. Stalk, very short, inserted in a deep and russety cavity. Flesh,
white, tender, soft and juicy, pleasantly flavored, but not at all rich.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of second-rate quality; but excellent for all culinary
purposes; it is in use from November to January. It is necessary in storing
this apple that care should be taken to prevent fermentation, by which
its pleasant acidity is destroyed.</p>

<p>The tree, though vigorous in its young state, never attains a great size.
Its shoots are long, slender and downy. It is an abundant and regular
bearer.</p>

<p>This apple is called Pomme de Jerusalem, from, as some fancy, the
core having four cells, which are disposed in the form of a cross, but
this is not a permanent character, as they vary from three to five.</p>

<p>Diel erred in applying the synonymes of Knoop’s Pigeon bigarré to
this variety, which is very distinct from the Pigeonnet.</p>

<h3 title="">273, 274. POMEROY.</h3>

<p>There are two very distinct varieties of apples, which, in different
parts of the country, are known by the same name of Pomeroy. The
one is that which is cultivated in Somersetshire and the West of England,
and the other is peculiar to Lancashire and the Northern counties.</p>

<p>The <span class="data_type">Pomeroy</span> <i>of Somerset</i>, is medium sized, two inches and three
quarters wide, and the same in height; conical. Skin, greenish-yellow,
covered with thin grey russet, on the shaded side; but orange, covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
with stripes of deep red, and marked with patches and spots of russet on
the side exposed to the sun, and strewed all over with numerous large,
dark russety dots. Eye, open, set in a round and even basin. Stalk,
short, not extending beyond the base, inserted in a round, even, and
russety cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, and highly flavored.</p>

<p>An excellent dessert apple; in use from October till December.</p>

<p>The <span class="data_type">Pomeroy</span> <i>of Lancashire</i>, is medium sized, two inches and three
quarters wide, and two inches and a half high; roundish, slightly ribbed
at the apex. Skin, smooth, pale yellow on the shaded side, but clear
pale red next the sun, which blends with the yellow towards the shaded
side, so as to form orange; the whole covered with russety dots. Eye,
small and closed, placed in a small and shallow basin. Stalk, short, imbedded
in an angular cavity with a swelling on one side of it, and from
which issue a few ramifications of russet. Flesh, whitish, tender, crisp,
juicy, and with a brisk flavor, a good deal like that of the Manks Codlin.</p>

<p>An excellent culinary apple; in use during September and October.</p>

<p>The tree is healthy, hardy, and an excellent bearer, well adapted for
orchard planting, and succeeds well in almost all situations.</p>

<p>There are several other varieties which are cultivated under this appellation,
to which local specific names are attached; but as I have not
seen any of these, they will be found among the “additional varieties” at
the end of that portion of this work which treats on the apple.</p>

inserted in a round and even cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp,
and pleasantly flavored.</p>

<p>A culinary apple; in use from December to January.</p>

<p>I think there is little doubt that this is the Pome Water of Gerard.
It is still grown in Lancashire, and on the borders of Cheshire, of which
county Gerard was a native, and with the fruits of which, he was, in all

<p>Fruit, large; ovate, handsomely and regularly formed. Skin, clear
yellow, tinged with greenish patches, and strewed with dark dots; on the
side next the sun it is marked with a few faint streaks of crimson. Eye,
large and open, like that of the Blenheim Pippin, and set in a wide and
plaited basin. Stalk, short, deeply inserted in a round cavity, which is
lined with rough russet, and with an incipient protuberance on one side
of it. Flesh, yellowish, tender, crisp, sugary and juicy, with a rich and
excellent flavor.</p>

<p>A very valuable apple either for the dessert or culinary purposes; it is
in use from November to March.</p>

<p>This variety has all the properties of the Blenheim Pippin, and is much
superior to it, keeps longer, and has the great advantage of being an early
and abundant bearer.</p>

<p>This excellent apple is as yet but little known. I met with it in the
neighbourhood of Sittingbourne, in Kent, where it is greatly esteemed
and now extensively cultivated for the supply of the London markets.
The account I received of it was, that the original tree grew in the garden
of a cottager of the name of Pope, at Cellar Hill, in the parish of
Linstead, near Sittingbourne. It was highly prized by its owner, to whom
the crop afforded a little income, and many were the unsuccessful applications
of his neighbours for grafts of what became generally known as
<i>Pope’s Apple</i>. The proprietor of this cottage built a row of other dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ings
adjoining it, in the gardens of which there were no fruit trees; for
the sake of uniformity, and in spite of Pope’s importunities and the offer
of twenty shillings annual increase in the rental, the tree was condemned,
and cut down in 1846, at which period it was between 50 and 60 years
old. A few days after it was destroyed, Mr. Fairbeard, a nurseryman at
Green Street, procured a number of the grafts which he was successful in
propagating, and it is to him I am indebted for this variety.</p>

color, marked with small broken stripes or streaks of crimson, and thickly
covered with small russety specks. Eye, closed, placed in a shallow,

<p>Perhaps there is no apple which at any period created such a sensation,
and of which so much was said and written during the 17th century, as
of the Red Streak. Prose and verse were both enlisted in its favor. It
was chiefly by the writings of Evelyn it attained its greatest celebrity.
Philips, in his poem&mdash;<i>Cyder</i>, says</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p class="no_indent">but its reputation began to decline about the beginning of the last century,
for we find Nourse saying, “As for the liquor which it yields, it is highly
esteemed for its noble colour and smell; ’tis likewise fat and oily in the
taste, but withal very windy, luscious and fulsome, and will sooner clog
the stomach than any other cider whatsoever, leaving a waterish, raw
humour upon it; so that with meals it is no way helpful, and they who
drink it, if I may judge of them by my own palate, will find their stomachs
pall’d sooner by it, than warm’d and enliven’d.”</p>

<p>The Red Streak seems to have originated about the beginning of the
17th century, for Evelyn says “it was within the memory of some now
living, surnamed the Scudamore’s Crab, and then not much known save
in the neighbourhood.” It was called Scudamore’s Crab, from being extensively
planted by the first Lord Scudamore, who was son of Sir James
Scudamore, from whom Spencer is said to have taken the character of
Sir Scudamore in his “Fairie Queen.” He was born in 1600, and created
by Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> Baron Dromore and Viscount Scudamore. He was attending
the Duke of Buckingham when he was stabbed at Portsmouth,
and was so affected at the event that he retired into private life, and devoted
his attention to planting orchards, of which the Red-Streak formed
the principal variety. In 1634 he was sent as ambassador to France, in
which capacity he continued for four years. He was a zealous royalist
during the civil wars, and was taken prisoner by the parliament party,
while his property was destroyed, and his estate sequestered. He died
in 1671.</p>

<p>This is an old Devonshire apple, and no doubt the <i>Sweet Rawling</i> referred
to in a communication to one of Bradley’s “Monthly Treatises,”
from which the following is an extract. “We have an apple in this
country called a Rawling, of which there is a sweet and a sour; the sour
when ripe (which is very early) is a very fair large fruit, and of a pleasant
taste, inclined to a golden color, full of narrow red streaks; the Sweet
Rawling, has the same colours but not quite so large, and if boiled grows
hard; whereas the sour becomes soft. Now what I have to inform you
of is, <i>viz.</i>: I have a tree which bears both sorts in one apple; one side of
the apple is altogether sweet, the other side sour; one side bigger than
the other; and when boiled the one side is soft, the other hard, as all
sweet and sour apples are.”</p>

<p>Fruit, above medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and two
inches and a half high; roundish-oblate, slightly angular on its sides, and
uneven round the eye. Skin, smooth, thickly covered with brown russety
spots; greenish-yellow, changing as it ripens to pale-yellow; and sometimes
tinged with red when fully exposed to the sun. Eye, partially open,
with long green segments, set in a wide, rather deep, and, prominently
plaited basin. Stalk, short, and thick, deeply inserted in a round cavity,
which is lined with greenish-grey russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender,
delicate, crisp and juicy, with a rich, sugary, and musky flavor.</p>

<p>A dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to April.
Roger Schabol says, it has been kept two years, in a cupboard excluded
from the air.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, and an abundant bearer; but subject to
canker, unless grown in light soil, and a dry and warm situation.</p>

<p>This is a very old French apple, varying very much in quality according
to the soil in which it is grown; but so highly esteemed in France
as to take as much precedence of all other varieties, as the Ribston and
Golden Pippin does in this country.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish, and irregular in its outline, caused by
several obtuse and unequal angles on its sides. Skin, greenish-yellow,
changing as it ripens to dull yellow, and marked with broken streaks of
pale red on the shaded side; but dull red changing to clear faint crimson,
marked with streaks of deeper crimson, on the side next the sun, and
generally russety over the base. Eye, small and closed, set in an irregular
basin, which is generally netted with russet. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
slender, and generally inserted its whole length in a round cavity, which is
surrounded with russet. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, rich and sugary,
charged with a powerful aromatic flavor.</p>

<p>An apple so well known, as to require neither description nor encomium.
It is in greatest perfection during November and December; but with
good management will keep till March.</p>

<p>The tree is in general hardy, a vigorous grower, and a good bearer,
provided it is grown in a dry soil; but if otherwise it is almost sure to
canker. In all the southern and middle counties of England it succeeds
well as an open standard; but in the north, and in Scotland, it requires
the protection of a wall to bring it to perfection. Nicol calls it “a universal
apple for these kingdoms; it will thrive at John O’Groat’s, while
it deserves a place at Exeter or at Cork.”</p>

<p>There is no apple which has ever been introduced to this country, or
indigenous to it, which is more generally cultivated, more familiarly
known, or held in higher popular estimation, than the Ribston Pippin. It
has long been in existence in this country, but did not become generally
known till the end of the last century. It is not mentioned in any of the
editions of Miller’s Dictionary, or by any other author of that period;
neither was it grown in the Brompton Park nursery in 1770. In 1785 I
find it was grown to the extent of a quarter of a row, or about 25 plants;
and as this supply seems to have sufficed for three years’ demand, its
merits must have been but little known. In 1788, it extended to one
row, or about one hundred plants, and three years later to two rows;
from 1791, it increased one row annually, till 1794, when it reached five
rows. From these facts we may pretty well learn the rise and progress of
its popularity. It is now in the same nursery cultivated to the extent of
about 25 rows, or 2500 plants annually.</p>

<p>The original tree was first discovered growing in the garden at Ribston
Hall, near Knaresborough, but how, when, or by what means it came
there, has not been satisfactorily ascertained. One account states that
about the year 1688, some apple pips were brought from Rouen and sown
at Ribston Hall, near Knaresborough; the trees then produced from them
were planted in the park, and one turned out to be the variety in question.
The original tree stood till 1810, when it was blown down by a violent
gale of wind. It was afterwards supported by stakes in a horizontal position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and continued to produce fruit till it lingered and died in 1835.
Since then, a young shoot has been produced about four inches below the
surface of the ground, which, with proper care, may become a tree, and
thereby preserve the original of this favorite old dessert apple. The gardener
at Ribston Hall, by whom this apple was raised, was the father of
Lowe, who during the last century was the fruit tree nurseryman at
Hampton Wick.</p>

</div>

<p>Fruit, small; roundish, narrowing towards the apex, where it is quite
flat, and covered with thin russet.
Skin, greenish-yellow on the shaded
side; but brownish-red where
exposed to the sun, and strewed
all over with minute russety dots.
Eye, prominent, not at all depressed,
and closed with broad flat segments.
Stalk, half-an-inch long,
stout, and inserted in a slight depression.
Flesh, greenish, tender,
crisp, sweet, and very juicy; with
a fine, brisk, poignant, and slightly
perfumed flavor, much resembling
that of the Golden Pippin and
Nonpareil.</p>

<p>A very excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from
December to February. The fruit is produced in clusters of sometimes
eight and ten, at the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>The tree is of small size and slender growth, and not a free bearer.
It is well adapted for dwarf and espalier training when grafted on the
doucin or paradise stock, in which case it also bears better than on the
crab stock.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Lindley this variety was grown for many years in
the old kitchen garden at Kew; and Rogers thinks it first originated
in the Turnham Green nursery, which was during a portion of the last
century, occupied by a person of the name of Robinson.</p>

inserted in a round, deep, smooth, and funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh,
yellowish-white tinged with green, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a sweet
and pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>A very good, but not first-rate, dessert apple; it is in use from November

identical with the Selwood’s Reinette of Rogers, who, as we are informed,
in his “Fruit Cultivator,” received it upwards of sixty years ago from
Messrs. Hewitt and Co., of Brompton. The tree now in my possession,
I procured as a graft from the private garden of the late Mr. Lee, of

I am induced to think that it is correct, while that of the Horticultural

a good deal in clusters, on slender wing branches.</p>

<p>Specific gravity of the juice, 1091.</p>

<p>This remarkable apple was raised by Mr. Knight from the seed
of the Yellow Siberian Crab, impregnated with the pollen of
the Golden Harvey. I cannot do better than transcribe from the
Transactions of the London Horticultural Society, Mr. Knight’s own
account of this apple. “The fruit contains much saccharine matter,
with scarcely any perceptible acid; and it in consequence affords a
cider, which is perfectly free from the harshness which in that liquid
offends the palate of many, and the constitution of more; and I
believe that there is not any county in England in which it might
not be made to afford, at a moderate price, a very wholesome and
very palatable cider. This fruit differs from all others of its species
with which I am acquainted, in being always sweet, and without acidity,
even when it is more than half grown.</p>

<p>“When the juice is pressed from ripe, and somewhat mellow fruit,
it contains a very large portion of saccharine matter; and if a part of
the water it contains be made to evaporate in a moderately low
temperature, it affords a large quantity of a jelly of intense sweetness,
which to my palate is extremely agreeable; and which may be employed
for purposes similiar to those to which the inspissated juice of the
grape is applied in France. The jelly of the apple prepared in the
manner above described, is, I believe, capable of being kept unchanged
during a very long period in any climate; the mucilage being preserved
by the antiseptic powers of the saccharine matter, and that being incapable
of acquiring, as sugar does, a state of crystallization. If the juice be
properly filtered, the jelly will be perfectly transparent.”</p>

<p>The tree is a strong and vigorous grower; a most abundant bearer,
and a perfect dreadnought to the woolly aphis.</p>

<p>Fruit, of the largest size; beautiful and handsome, roundish, and
somewhat depressed. Skin, bright lively green, almost entirely covered
with broken streaks, and patches of fine deep red, and thickly strewed
with russety dots; in some specimens the color extends almost entirely

with short erect ragged segments, set in a deep, irregular, and angular
basin. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly acid.</p>

<p>One of the handsomest and best culinary apples in cultivation; for
baking it is unrivalled. It is in use from October till May.</p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, and an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>This noble apple was introduced by Mr. George Lindley, who found
it growing in 1794, in the garden of William Crowe, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, at Lakenham
near Norwich. He measured a specimen of the fruit, and found it
twelve inches and a half in circumference, and weighing twelve ounces
and a half, avoirdupoise. It does not seem ever to have been in general
cultivation, as it is not mentioned in any of the nursery catalogues;
nor is it enumerated in that of the London Horticultural Society.
Through the kindness of George Jefferies, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of Marlborough Terrace,
Kensington, who procured it from his residence in Norfolk, I had the
good fortune in 1847, to obtain grafts, which when propagated, I
distributed through several of the principal nurseries of the country,
and by this means I trust, it will become more generally known, and
universally cultivated.</p>

<p>This variety was raised in 1807, by Thomas Netherton Parker, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,

<p>Fruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter broad, by one
inch and three quarters high; roundish-oblate. Skin, yellowish-green,
but entirely covered with brown russet, strewed with silvery grey scales;
sometimes it has a brownish tinge on the side which is exposed to the

long, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, and
juicy, with a rich, sugary, and very high flavor.</p>

<p>One of the most excellent
dessert apples; it is in use
from October to February.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower,
hardy, and an excellent bearer;
it attains about the middle
size, and is well adapted for
growing as an espalier, when
grafted on the paradise stock.</p>

<p>This variety originated at
the village of Syke House, in
Yorkshire, whence its name.</p>

<p>Diel’s nomenclature of the
Syke House Russet, affords a
good example of the transformations
the names of fruits are subject to, when translated from one
language to another; he writes it Englische Spitalsreinette, which he
translates Sik-House Apple, because as he supposed it received this
appellation, either from the briskness of its flavor being agreeable to
invalids, or from its having originated in the garden of an hospital,
He says he finds it only in Kirke’s Fruit Tree Catalogue, <i>where it is
erroneously printed Syke-House</i>!</p>

<p>Fruit, above medium size; roundish-ovate, or conical, even and
regularly formed. Skin, smooth and shining, covered with a fine violet-colored
bloom, and yellow, striped with red, on the shaded side; but of
a dark red, approaching to black, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye,
closed, set in a rather deep and plaited basin. Stalk, three quarters of
an inch long, stout, and inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white,
tinged with red under the skin, which is filled with red juice,
leaving a stain on the knife with which it is cut; firm, juicy, and sugary,
with a vinous and pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of good, but not first-rate quality; in use from
October to March.</p>

<p>Duhamel, and following him, almost all the French writers on
pomology, attribute the name of this apple to the perfume of violets
being found in the flavor of the fruit; a peculiarity I could never detect.
It is more probable it originated from the fruit being covered with a
beautiful blue violet bloom, a characteristic which was observed by
Rivinius and Moulin, a hundred and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>A valuable, and highly flavored dessert apple of the first quality; it
is in use from November to April; and as Mr. Lindley says, when
ripened, and begins to shrivel, it is one of the best russets of its season.</p>

<p>The tree is a free grower, healthy, and hardy, but does not attain
above the middle size. It is generally a good bearer, and succeeds well
in almost any soil, provided it be not too moist.</p>

<p>This apple was raised by James Wheeler, the founder of the Gloucester
nursery, now in the occupation of his grandson, Mr. J. Cheslin Wheeler.
He was an intelligent and assiduous man in his profession, and published
in 1763, “The Botanist’s and Gardener’s New Dictionary.” He died
about the beginning of the present century, having attained over ninety

<p>The Transparent Apple of Rogers, and the Muscovy Apple of
Mortimer, cannot be identical with this variety, for they are described
by both as winter apples; may they not be the <i>Russischer Glasapfel, or
Astracanischer Winterapfel</i> of Diel?</p>

<p>Respecting this apple,
a correspondent in the
Gardener’s Chronicle,
for 1845, has the following
remark, “When at
Reval many years ago,
I made particular inquiries
as to the mode
of cultivation of the
Transparent Apple; I
learned that the soil of
the apple orchards there,
is almost a pure sand,
but that it is customary to
add to it so much stable
manure, that half the
bulk of ground may be
said to consist of manure.
The friend with whom
I was staying, had some
of these apples at
dessert; they were transparent, not in blotches, but throughout, so that
held to the light, the pips may be seen from every part; these apples
were juicy as a peach, about the size of a large one, and of a very
agreeable flavor and texture.”</p>

is no doubt the correct name of this apple. The name is supposed to
be derived from its resemblance to the <i>whorle</i>, which was the propelling
power, or rather impetus of the spindle, when the distaff and spindle

<p>Fruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two
inches and a quarter high; roundish, widest at the middle, and narrowing
towards the crown, round which are a few small ridges. Skin, smooth
and shining, of a dark lively green, strewed with minute russety dots;
and with a blush of dull red where exposed to the sun. Eye, small and
closed, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long,
inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, greenish,
very close in texture, brittle and juicy, with a very poignant and
pleasant acid.</p>

<p>A culinary apple of first-rate quality, which comes into use in
November, and has been known to last under favorable circumstances,
for two years. Dry sand is a good article to preserve it in.</p>

<p>The tree is very hardy, a free and good grower, and an abundant bearer.</p>

<p>I have not adopted here, the nomenclature of the Horticultural
Society’s Catalogue, for two reasons. First, because Winter Greening
is the previous name, and, so far as I can find, the original one. It is also
very applicable, and not subject to the same objection which Mr. Lindley
has to French Crab. Second, because there is already in the Horticultural
Society’s Catalogue, the “White Easter”&mdash;the “Paasch Appel,”
of Knoop&mdash;and the two names being so similar, may tend to confusion,
a result of already too frequent occurrence, and most desirable to be
avoided. The name Winter Greening is also more descriptive.</p>

<p>Fruit, medium sized; roundish-ovate, with ribs round the crown.
Skin, smooth, dark green, covered with thin dull brownish-red on the
side next the sun. Eye, small and open, set in a deep basin, which is
much furrowed and plaited. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long,
slender, inserted in a deep and narrow cavity, which is lined with russet.
Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.</p>

<p>A first-rate culinary apple, bearing a considerable resemblance to the
London Pippin, but does not change to yellow color by keeping as
that variety does. It is in use from January to May.</p>

<p>This variety is, strictly speaking, a Norfolk apple, where it is much
grown for the local markets. It was first made public by Mr. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Lindley, who introduced it to the notice of the London Horticultural
Society. In the “Guide to the Orchard,” it is stated that the Aphis
Lanigera or “Meally Bug,” so destructive to most of our old orchard
trees, seems to be set at defiance by the Majetin. “An old tree now
growing in a garden belonging to Mr. William Youngman, of Norwich,
which had been grafted about three feet high in the stem, has been for
many years attacked by this insect below the grafted part, but never
above it; the limbs and branches being to this day perfectly free,
although all the other trees in the same garden have been infested more
or less with it.”</p>

<p>The tree is a most abundant bearer.</p>

<p>Fruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and about the same in
height; of a true pearmain shape, somewhat five sided towards the
crown. Skin, smooth and shining, at first of a greenish-yellow, marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
with faint streaks of dull red on the shaded side, and entirely covered

deep yellow, streaked with flesh color on the shaded side; but of a
beautiful, clear, deep red or crimson, on the side next the sun, and
strewed all over with small russety dots. Eye, large and open, with
short segments, set in a pretty deep, and prominently plaited basin.
Stalk, very short, not exceeding a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a
deep, funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish,
firm, crisp, juicy, and sugary, with a brisk, poignant, and very pleasant
flavor.</p>

<p>A highly esteemed old English apple, suitable principally for culinary
purposes, but also valuable for the dessert; it is in use from December
to the end of April.</p>

<p>The tree attains about the middle size, is a free and healthy grower,
and an excellent bearer.</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the oldest existing English apple on record. It is
noticed as being cultivated in Norfolk, as early as the year 1200,&mdash;what
evidence against Mr. Knight’s theory! In Blomefield’s History of
Norfolk, there is mention of a tenure in that county by petty serjeanty,
and the payment of two hundred pearmains, and four hogsheads of cider
of pearmains into the Exchequer, at the feast of St. Michael, yearly.
It is the original of all the Pearmains, a name now applied to a great
variety of apples. Much doubt has existed as to the origin of this word,
and in a communication to the Gardener’s Chronicle for 1848, I there
stated what I conceived to be its meaning. The early forms in which
it was written, will be seen from the synonymes above, they were
Pearemaine and Peare-maine. In some early historical works of the
same period, I have seen Charlemagne written <i>Charlemaine</i>, the last
portion of the word having the same termination as <i>Pearemaine</i>. Now,
Charlemagne being derived from <i>Carolus magnus</i> there is every probability
that Pearemaine is derived from <i>Pyrus magnus</i>. The signification
therefore of Pearmain is the <i>Great Pear Apple</i>, in allusion no doubt, to
the varieties known by that name, bearing a resemblance to the form of
a pear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The Winter Quoining, is a very old English apple. I have here
adopted an orthography, different from that usually employed, because
I conceive it to be the most correct. The name is derived from the
word Coin or Quoin, the corner stones of a building, because of the
angles or corners on the sides of the fruit. Thus Rea in his Pomona says,
when speaking of this apple, “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">it succeeds incomparably on the paradise
apple, as the Colviele, (Calville) and all other sorts of Queenings do</span>,” regarding
the Calville also as a Queening from the angularity of its shape.</p>

<p>This is one of the oldest cider apples, and is highly commended by
the writers of the seventeenth century; but according to Mr. Knight it
has long ceased to deserve the attention of the planter. It is said
that the name of this apple, is derived from an imagined resemblance
in the form of the fruit, and fruit-stalk, in some instances, to
the head and beak of a woodcock; but Mr. Knight thinks it probable
that it was raised by a person of that name.</p>

and even in the dessert, when well ripened, Mr. Knight considered it
closely resembled the Newtown Pippin. The tree is hardy, healthy, a
free and abundant bearer. It has been found to succeed in every latitude

found it to succeed well as an espalier. It ought to be cultivated in

<h2><a name="ADDITIONAL_VARIETIES_OF_APPLES" id="ADDITIONAL_VARIETIES_OF_APPLES">ADDITIONAL VARIETIES OF APPLES.</a></h2>

<p>The following is an enumeration of apples which are known to exist
in Great Britain, but of the great majority of which I have no personal
knowledge. They are either recorded in other works on pomology, or
have been communicated to me by correspondents. The most of these
have only a local reputation, and do not possess sufficient merit to make
them attractive out of their own districts. A great number are continental
varieties, which have chiefly been introduced through the instrumentality
of the London Horticultural Society, in whose garden they
are only to be found; and many of these are worthy of being more
generally known. There are also several varieties which have come under
my notice, since the preceding part of this work was published; but of
the greater part enumerated, I have had no opportunity of seeing the
fruit; the descriptions, therefore, are either from the works in which
they are recorded, or the correspondents with whom I have communicated;
my object in supplying these additional varieties, being to furnish a
complete record of all that are known to exist in Great Britain so far as
that can be ascertained.</p>

<h3 title="">506. DEVONSHIRE WILDING.</h3>

<p>Is a favorite sort in North Devon, for the manufacture of rough
cider of great strength, so much relished by the laborers of that country.
The fruit is of middle size, nearly round, flatted at the ends; color,
yellowish-green, dotted with brown; the stalk short and thick, and
closely attached to the branch, and hanging long on the tree. The pulp
is firm, and well charged with a sharp acid juice. When cider is made
of it, alone, the fruit is kept for a month before going to the mill. The
tree grows strongly, and rises to rank in the first class in the orchard;
and is, like most of the cider apples, very seldom attacked by the
American blight.&mdash;<a href="#ROG_FR_CULT" title="Rogers Fruit Cultivator" class="ref">Rog. Fr. Cult.</a> 111.</p>

<p>The Vandervere, when in perfection, is one of the most beautiful and
finest apples. But it requires a rich, light, sandy soil, as in a damp
heavy soil, it is almost always liable to be spotted, unfair, and destitute
of flavor. It is a native of Wilmington, Delaware, and took its name
from a family there. It is a fine old variety, and is highly worthy of
extensive cultivation, where the soil is favorable.</p>

<p>Fruit, of medium size, flat. Skin, in its ground color, yellow, streaked
and stained with clouded red, but on the sunny side, deepening into rich
red, dotted with light grey specks. Stalk, short, inserted in a smooth,
rather wide cavity. Calyx, small, closed, set in a regular, well formed,
basin, of moderate depth. Flesh, yellow, crisp, and tender, with a rich
and sprightly juice. October to January.&mdash;<a href="#DOWN_FR_AMER" title="Downing Fruit America" class="ref">Down. Fr. Amer.</a> 142.</p>

<p>Such is the character of this apple in its native country; but on this
side of the Atlantic, it ranks only as a second-rate fruit. If however, it
were grown in a favorable situation as indicated above, it might be
brought to a greater degree of perfection.&mdash;<i>H.</i></p>

unctuous when handled, at first of a pale clear yellow, which
changes by keeping to a very beautiful pure waxen, and shining lemon-yellow,
faintly washed with a clear, delightful red, on the exposed
side only. Eye, half open, set in a wide and deep basin. Stalk, very
short, sometimes only a small fleshy knob, inserted in a wide, deep, and
funnel-shaped cavity, lined with russet. Flesh, beautiful white, fine,
marrowy, and juicy, with a sweet, vinous, very agreeable, refreshing,
somewhat aromatic flavor. Ripens in September, and is in greatest
perfection in October.&mdash;<a href="#DIEL_KERNOBST" title="Diel Kernobstsorten" class="ref">Diel Kernobst.</a> vii. 137.</p>

called a good second-rate fruit; it is an excellent bearer, and well
worth the attention of market-gardeners. Its stiff upright growth
